The theme for the year was: 
ArtIst + Technology. 

<img src="/images/syf2.jpg" style="width:60%">

The art piece is inspired by cartoons depicting a fantasy world and foreign pop culture (i.e. Japanese pop culture) that has been highly promoted through the advancements of digital media. The silver veins represent the accessibility of the internet while the shiny, surrealistic wire creatures add an illuminating appeal to the piece.<
