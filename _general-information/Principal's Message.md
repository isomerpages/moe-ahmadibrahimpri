I am Ms Ong Lee Choo, the new Principal of Ahmad Ibrahim Primary School. I am very happy to have the privilege to work alongside a team of dedicated educators to serve the school and the community. I would like to welcome you back to the new school year and also to extend my warmest welcome to those who have just joined the Ahmad Ibrahim Primary family.  

  

Our school has come a long way from its humble beginnings back in 1995. And as we enter into our 24th year in service of education, we pledge to continue our important role of providing quality holistic education to nurture the whole child. Moving forward, we seek to build a school culture of continuous improvement and innovation. Our guiding principles are: 1) Providing quality education for all students and 2) Maximizing learning potential of all students. Our journey centers on developing our students to be inspiring learners for life. We strongly believe in and aim to inculcate in them the attributes of having a sense of curiosity of things, the courage to experiment and explore, and a strong sense of purpose to pursue excellence in everything they do. We want them to dare to dream and be the best that they can be. We would provide avenues and opportunities to unleash the potential of our students, cater to their varied needs and develop them to be Leaders of Character and Learners for Life. Our teachers will continue to strive to deepen their teaching and learning practices to bring about joyful and meaningful learning experiences to stimulate curiosity and enthusiasm in our students.

  

We strongly believe that parents are the schoolâ€™s most crucial collaborative partners in growing our students and contributing to their success in learning. We would like to thank our parents and all our stakeholders for their support in all our undertakings all these years. Let us continue to work together to give the best possible education for each child and multiply our efforts to make every child an engaged learner. We look forward to your continuous strong support and great partnership. We are confident that it will be another exciting, enriching and fruitful year for all at Ahmad Ibrahim Primary. Wishing all a wonderful year ahead with good health, successful endeavors and joyous moments.
