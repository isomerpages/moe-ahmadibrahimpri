The school commemorated the Youth for Environmental Sustainability (YES) Programme on Monday, 17 April 2023. 

  

Through this programme, we hope to encourage youth advocacy towards environmental sustainability in Singapore. This is in line with this year’s, ‘Say YES to Waste Less campaign’, launched by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Singapore Green Plan. The message brought forward was focused on bringing food waste to the forefront by highlighting how our students can play their part in reducing food waste.  

  

The school had kickstarted the programme with an assembly talk in the morning and a set of engaging fringe activities conducted during the recess periods to drive the message home that everyone plays a part in sustainability.
