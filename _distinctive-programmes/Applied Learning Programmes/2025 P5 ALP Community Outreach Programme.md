<p>The P5 ALP Community Outreach Programme is an annual initiative that empowers
our ALP Ambassadors to champion water conservation among preschoolers.
Through the training sessions, our student ambassadors gain essential knowledge
about water sustainability and develop key skills in design thinking, planning,
facilitation, and oral presentation. They then apply these skills by designing
and leading engaging activities for the preschoolers. This meaningful experience
nurtures their Critical and Inventive Thinking, as well as their Communication
and Collaboration skills, while fostering a strong sense of social responsibility
and active contribution to the community.</p>
