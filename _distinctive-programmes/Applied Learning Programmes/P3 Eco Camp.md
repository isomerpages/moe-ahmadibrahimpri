<h4><strong>Primary 3 Eco-Camp at Gardens by the Bay</strong></h4>
<p>Our Primary 3 students had an enriching learning journey to Gardens by
the Bay, exploring biodiversity, conservation, and sustainability. Surrounded
by the diverse plant collections, they discovered the richness of our natural
world and the importance of protecting it.</p>
<p>Engaging activities highlighted conservation efforts, while the students
also learned about sustainable practices within the Gardens, such as water
and energy efficiency. This hands-on experience fostered a deeper understanding
of environmental stewardship and empowered our young learners to embrace
sustainable living. The trip was an inspiring and impactful learning adventure.</p>
