The ALP Interactive Learning Walls were designed to help students learn more about environmental issues happening around them and what they can contribute to create a sustainable environment. The colourful design and the three-dimensional features enhance the interaction with the students. In addition, students can access more information by scanning the Augmented Reality (AR) markers on the walls using IT devices.
