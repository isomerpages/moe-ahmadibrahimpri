Primary 6 Eco Camp

The Primary 6 students went to Gardens by the Bay and explored the plants and learnt about their adaptations. 

The objectives of this programme are:
 
·       To provide an authentic experience for students to apply their
knowledge and skills learnt and embrace learning with joy.
·       To better understand and appreciate the adaptations of organisms in an
environment, and the importance of environmental conservation.
