Our school is cultivating a new generation of green thumbs with an exciting hands-on programme for our Primary 3 and 4 students. Through the magic of hydroponics, these young learners are diving into the fascinating world of plant science by growing their very own Kang Kong and spinach.

Forget messy soil! Our students are discovering how these leafy vegetables thrive in nutrient-rich water solutions, all within state-of-the-art hydroponic systems right here on campus. This innovative approach allows them to witness firsthand the vital roles of water, light, and nutrients in plant growth, fostering a deeper understanding of the food cycle and sustainable agriculture.

From carefully planting seedlings to monitoring their growth and eventually harvesting their crops, the children are actively involved in every stage of the process. This programme not only imparts valuable scientific knowledge but also cultivates teamwork, responsibility, and a genuine appreciation for where their food comes from. The vibrant green shoots of Kang Kong and spinach are more than just vegetables; they represent a journey of discovery and a tangible connection to the natural world for our young budding botanists.
