<p><strong><u>Overseas Learning Journey to Kuching, Sarawak</u></strong>
</p>
<p>From 21 to 24 May 2025, 21 Primary 5 students, accompanied by 4 teachers
and our Vice-Principal, Mrs Chia, embarked on a meaningful Overseas Learning
Journey to Kuching, Sarawak. Our group had the opportunity to engage in
a series of enriching and memorable experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Students’ Reflections:</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The Sarawak trip is and will be my most
memorable learning journey. It was my first time riding on a plane and
going somewhere further than Kuala Lumpur. I learnt many new things such
as the Sarawakian culture and traditions.”</p>
<p>- Nur Adlina Binte Mohammad Hedzir</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “On this trip, I learnt so much about
the Sarawakian culture. My favourite part of the trip is the Sarawak Biodiversity
Centre. It was so nice to learn about the special plants of Borneo. I learnt
that the orangutan is the biggest primate animal in Asia. It was also great
having roommates for the first time in my life.”</p>
<p>- Armaan Khan S/O Mohamed Ashraff</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What I like about Sarawak is their history,
museums, places and performances. We visited wildlife environments that
were home to many orangutans. Some of them are big and some of them are
small. I had so much fun with my Sarawakian buddy and my roommates. They
were always on my side and always helping me. I am very grateful for this
trip. Thank you teachers and Mrs Chia for bringing me and my friends overseas!”</p>
<p>- Nur Hazwani Binti Muhammad Luqman Naim</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I learnt about team work and other cultures.
I also enjoyed the experience of going to St Mary’s School. It was so fun
to learn about other traditions. We should respect all and not judge others.”</p>
<p>- Adwa Ukhuwah Binte Abdullah</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It was a great opportunity to meet people
from Kuching. I really enjoyed it with my friends.”</p>
<p>- Hsu Li Ting<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<p><strong>School Immersion at St Mary’s Primary School</strong>
</p>
<p>One of our key highlights of the trip was the school immersion programme
at St Mary’s Primary School in Kuching. Our students were warmly welcomed
and paired with friendly Kuching buddies, fostering immediate connections
and cultural exchange. Through the guided tour around the school, we appreciated
the vibrant learning environment. The highlight of the visit was learning
traditional Sarawakian songs (“Bapak Mek Datang”) and the cultural Bidayuh
dance with their buddies. All these offered our students a deeper understanding
of Sarawak’s rich heritage. In return, our students proudly performed a
lively dance to “Reach Out for the Skies” as a gesture of appreciation.
The visit concluded with a heartfelt gift exchange, each gift meaningfully
put together by our students in appreciation of the strong bonds formed
during this memorable experience.</p>
