<p><strong><u>Overseas Learning Journey to Shanghai, China</u></strong>
</p>
<p>From 14 to 18 April 2025, 20 selected Primary 5 students, accompanied
by 4 teachers and our Principal, Ms Baey, embarked on a meaningful Overseas
Learning Journey to Shanghai, China. This enriching experience not only
broadened their global perspectives but also deepened their appreciation
for Chinese culture and education.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>School Immersion at Shanghai Normal University Demonstration School, Luwan</strong>
</p>
<p>A key highlight of the trip was the two half-day school immersion at our
twinning school, Shanghai Normal University Demonstration School, Luwan.
We were warmly welcomed with a delightful cultural performance specially
prepared by the students and teachers of SHNU Luwan.</p>
<p>Our students were paired with their Shanghai buddies, who gave them a
guided tour of the beautiful school compound and shared about the school’s
programmes. The classroom experiences were both exciting and engaging:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Science Lesson – Destination Imagination (DI):</strong> Our students
put on their thinking caps and worked in teams to solve a creative challenge
— to prevent an ice cream cone from falling while using a basketball.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Art Lesson:</strong> The students enjoyed crafting their own badges
and paper puppets, culminating in a shadow puppet performance guided by
the Shanghai teachers and their helpful buddies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PE Lesson:</strong> Students from both schools bonded through traditional
Chinese games, gaining insight into the local culture while having fun
together.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our teachers had the valuable opportunity to observe how technology is
thoughtfully integrated into classroom teaching in China. The innovative
practices they witnessed left a deep impression, sparking new ideas for
their own teaching.
<br>
<br>As a gesture of appreciation, our students presented a specially prepared
performance item — a Singapore Beloved Medley — to express heartfelt thanks
for the warm hospitality received. Both schools also exchanged gifts, symbolising
the growing friendship and mutual respect between our communities.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Cultural and Educational City Tour</strong>
</p>
<p>Beyond the classroom, our students explored the vibrant city of Shanghai,
immersing themselves in its rich history and modern wonders. They visited
iconic landmarks such as the Oriental Pearl Tower, The Bund, Nanjing Road,
Qibao Ancient Town, Sun Yat-sen’s Former Residence, and the Shanghai Natural
History Museum, and also gained valuable insights during a factory tour
at Volkswagen SAIC. The trip concluded on a high note with a spectacular
acrobatic performance that left everyone in awe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This unforgettable learning journey was filled with cultural exchange,
friendship, and hands-on experiences. It has created fond memories for
our students and ignited a greater curiosity about the world beyond our
shores.
