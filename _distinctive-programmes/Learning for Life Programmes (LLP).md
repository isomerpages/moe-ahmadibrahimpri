<p>At AIPS, each student is regarded as a possible agent of change for his
or her family and society. The school firmly believes in developing every
child as a leader and they are never too young to serve the school and
wider community.</p>
<p>The 3Rs – Leader U Character Development Programme - From Values to Action:
Developing Community-based Student Leaders is our signature LLP. It is
a character-based leadership programme in which every child is provided
with the opportunity to lead through Values-In-Action activities. Through
these authentic learning experiences, we believe that students grow as
community-based student leaders when they put their values into actions.
In this programme, students are nurtured to be socially responsible leaders
who are able to lead and serve the school, community and wider community.
The programme aims to nurture and inspire AIPS students to be respectful,
resilient and responsible leaders who contribute their services to their
peers, school and community.</p>
<h4>Every Child A Leader Leadership Camps</h4>
<p>Every year, the school runs a series of ‘Every Child a Leader’ Leadership
Camps across the levels to inculcate the school values and imbue skillsets
in the students based on the five practices of exemplary leadership (Kouzes
&amp; Posner). Leadership camps have always been the highlight in terms
of holistic experiences for our students. These camps serve as a platform
for the students to display their leadership qualities through participation
in innovative and interactive activities and provide our students with
the opportunities for rich learning all year round.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of what transpires in the Leadership Camps:</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Primary 3 Leadership Camp: Growing Together Workshop</h4>
