At AIPS, each student is regarded as a possible agent of change for his or her family and society. The school firmly believes in developing every child as a leader and they are never too young to serve the school and wider community.

The 3Rs – Leader U Character Development Programme - From Values to Action: Developing Community-based Student Leaders is our signature LLP. It is a character-based leadership programme in which every child is provided with the opportunity to lead through Values-In-Action activities. Through this authentic learning experiences, we believe that students grow as community-based student leaders as they put their values into actions. In this programme, students are nurtured to be socially responsible leaders who are able to lead and serve the school, community and wider community. The programme aims to nurture and inspire AIPS students to be respectful, resilient and responsible leaders who contribute their services to their peers, school and community. 

  

Feature programmes include the following:

  

#### **1) Brightspots@AIPS**

  

Brightspots@AIPS aims to encourage students to take ownership of the cleanliness of their environment through daily cleaning sessions. Students lead and model the way to keep their environment clean and play an active role in school. This is in line with the vision to nurture students to be socially responsible as they put their knowledge and skills into actions to play a part for the environment.

#### **2) 'Every Child A Leader' Leadership Camps** 

Every year, the school runs a series of ‘Every Child a Leader’ Leadership Camps across the levels to inculcate the school values and imbue skillsets in the students based on the five practices of exemplary leadership (Kouzes & Posner). Leadership camps have always been the highlight in terms of holistic experiences for our students. These camps serve as a platform for the students to display their leadership qualities through participation in innovative and interactive activities and provide our students with the opportunities for rich learning all year round. 

Here are some examples of what transpires in the Leadership Camps:

**Primary 3 Leadership Camp: Growing Together Workshop**

Our P3 students went through their leadership camp with plenty of team games and activities that challenged them to think out of the box as they practised the leadership practice of challenging the process. They learnt the importance of teamwork and communicating effectively to achieve their common goal. At the same time, they learn to manage themselves and their emotions as they go through the obstacle courses and team games.

**Primary 5 Leadership Camp: Intergenerational Mentoring Workshop**

  

Our P5 students displayed the value of empathy when they went through the Intergenerational Mentoring Workshop as they practiced the fifth practice of encouraging others to act. They had the chance to put themselves in the shoes of the elderly through enriching and fun activities during the camp. They also worked collaboratively in groups in solving problems and team challenges as they embarked on a mini project to aid the elderly.

Our P6 students went through a Rise with Resilience Workshop in which they experienced team games and activities to develop their mental resilience in facing challenges in school. Through journaling, they develop confidence in learning to take control of their emotions and in setting personal goals. Not only that, they also displayed the values of resilience and responsibility as they cultivate a positive growth mindset in their learning aptitude.
