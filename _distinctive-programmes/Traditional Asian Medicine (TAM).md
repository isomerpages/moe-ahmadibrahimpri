**Traditional Asian Medicine (TAM)**&nbsp;is the Mother Tongue Language school-based curriculum designed to allow our students to have a deeper appreciation of their Mother Tongue Language and culture through a variety of learning activities conducted in our own TCM Room and Traditional Herb Garden.

The TAM curriculum is first introduced to lower primary students where students learn simple medicinal properties of common food and how to describe symptoms of common illnesses in their Mother Tongue Languages through drama.  

P3-P5 students will then embark on learning trails incorporated in a mobile app as part of the TAM curriculum implementation. The app will feature an interactive learning trail that focuses on the key elements of TAM (i.e. the stories of Chinese Physicians, functions of different herbs found at the AIPS TAM Herbs Garden in Chinese and Malay traditional medicine as well as Ayurveda treatment, etc).  

After introducing the students to TAM knowledge over the initial 5 years, the collaboration with community partners provides platforms for our Upper Primary students to engage in meaningful experiential learning beyond the school.&nbsp;Students who show interest in TAM are appointed as TAM Ambassadors. The ambassadors will receive in-house training on leadership skills and related TAM knowledge. The TAM curriculum has provided opportunities for the students to transfer their learning and put good values and skills in action. The TAM Ambassadors in school get to apply the knowledge, skills and values through the values-in-action activities co-created between the school and her community partners.
