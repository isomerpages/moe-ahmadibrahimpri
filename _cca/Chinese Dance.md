#### SYF 2022
Ahmad Ibrahim Primary Schoolâ€™s Chinese Dance team took part in SYF Arts Presentation 2022 after the covid years. The children strongly displayed the values of resilience and teamwork, to showcase their best performance. We also provide various platforms for our pupils to showcase their strengths and develop their self-confidence and teamwork. They never fail to display energy, enthusiasm and commitment when showcasing their talents and grow to be resilient children. We are very proud of their achievements!
