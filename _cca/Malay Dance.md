Ahmad Ibrahim Malay Dance CCA comprises of about 30 students from Primary 2 to Primary 5 girls and boys.

  

Our main objective of this CCA is to expose pupils to a repertoire of traditional Malay Dance namely ‘Inang’, ‘Masri’, ‘Zapin’, ‘Joget’ and ‘Asli’ and provide a platform for pupils to showcase their capabilities and strengths in the performing arts. It also aims to instil confidence in the pupils while they are performing and showcasing their talent. Through this CCA, pupils also learn the values such as perseverance, self-discipline and commitment.

  

Various platforms were given to the pupils to showcase their talent such as performing for school and external events. With these platforms given, they will develop their self-confidence and leadership skills. Our school engages a professional dance instructor from Sri Warisan Performing Arts to train our pupils.
