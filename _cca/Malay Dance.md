The main objective of our Malay Dance club is L.O.V.E : <br>
1) Leadership – Give students an opportunity to hone their leadership skills
2) Ownership – Give students a sense of ownership and a sense of pride to the school
3) Values – To instill positive values aligned with the school values such as the 3 Rs (Respect, responsibility &amp; Resilience)
4) Expose – To expose students to the 5 traditional forms of Malay Dance namely the Inang, Masri, Zapin, Joget &amp; Asli.

Aligned with L.O.V.E, students will be given various platforms to showcase their talents. They will also take part in fun activities that build rapport and a sense of camaraderie with their teammates such as termly birthday celebrations, Welcome Tea (for new members) &amp; an annual Farewell Party (for graduating students).
