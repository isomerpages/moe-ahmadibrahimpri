<h2><strong> P6 Graduation Party 2024</strong></h2>
<p>It has become a cherished yearly tradition for our Dance Club to host
a special party in honour of our graduating Primary 6 dancers. During this
celebration, our members receive certificates in recognition of their contributions
to the club, while SYF dancers are also presented with their Certificates
of Participation.</p>
<p>The dancers enjoy a meal together, share heartfelt speeches, and bid their
final goodbyes with warm hugs and fond memories. This year, we are delighted
to continue this meaningful tradition on Tuesday, 18 November 2025.</p>

<h2><strong>Hari Raya Concert 2025</strong></h2>
<p>During the school’s Hari Raya Celebrations, the AIPS Malay Dance Club
added colour and joy to the festive occasion with a lively and graceful
performance. Primary 6 dancers <strong>Nisrina and Dayana Maisarah</strong> from <strong>6 Excellence</strong> warmly
welcomed our Vice-Principal with a beautiful <strong>welcome dance</strong>,
gracefully scattering <strong>flower petals</strong> as a mark of respect
and celebration. The rest of the dance team then took to the stage, dressed
in <strong>vibrant Baju Melayu</strong> in shades of green, gold and blue,
dancing energetically to a <strong>Hari Raya song</strong> that filled the
hall with festive cheer. Their performance reflected the spirit of unity,
tradition, and joy that Hari Raya brings to the school community.</p>
