Badminton aims to help our pupils develop positive team spirit and enhance their athleticism and general physical fitness. With a structured training programme and dedicated coach, we are looking forward to developing our pupils' interest and talent in Badminton. We aim to develop each student holistically and also give them the opportunity to represent the school in competitions.
