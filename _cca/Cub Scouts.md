<p>As part of the Singapore Scouts Association (SSA), the objective of the
Cub Scouts program is to provide a group environment which is intellectually
stimulating, physically vital and directed towards satisfying the child‚Äôs
basic need to face and overcome challenges. Based on the Scout Promise
and Law, we provide life skills activities such as first-aid, knotting,
outdoor cooking, hikes, camps and rock-climbing.</p>
<p>There are also proficiency and progress badges to be obtained, and these
can be pursued based on personal interests. Our Cub Scouts program is dynamic
and diverse, there's always something interesting to do!</p>

<p>Our Cub Scouts had an exciting afternoon at Northbrooks Secondary School
on 7 May 2025, where they took on the challenge of rock climbing! üí™üéâ</p>
<p>&nbsp;From scaling walls, tying knots to building resilience, our students
pushed past their limits and had loads of fun while learning valuable skills.
Big cheers to our Cubs for showing courage and teamwork every step of the
way! üëè</p>

<p><strong>2025 National Day Ceremory</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Cub Scouts played a significant role in our school's recent National
Day celebrations, proudly escorting the National Flag to begin the ceremony.
They performed their duty with great discipline and pride, representing
our scout group with honor in front of the entire school. Their participation
was a highlight of the event, and they certainly did us all proud.</p>
