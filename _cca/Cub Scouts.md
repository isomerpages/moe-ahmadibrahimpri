As part of the Singapore Scouts Association (SSA), the objective of the Cub Scouts program is to provide a group environment which is intellectually stimulating, physically vital and directed towards satisfying the child’s basic need to face and overcome challenges. Based on the Scout Promise and Law, we provide life skills activities such as first-aid, knotting, outdoor cooking, hikes, camps and rock-climbing.

  

There are also proficiency and progress badges to be obtained, and these can be pursued based on personal interests. Our Cub Scouts program is dynamic and diverse, there's always something interesting to do!

In conjunction with the Diamond Jubilee Challenge on the theme “Environment”, the cub scouts went around during the CCA session to their teachers, friends and staff in the school to explain the importance of their roles in creating an impact for the environment and for them to pledge in helping the environment.
