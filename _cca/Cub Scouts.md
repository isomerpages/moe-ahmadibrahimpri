As part of the Singapore Scouts Association (SSA), the objective of the Cub Scouts program is to provide a group environment which is intellectually stimulating, physically vital and directed towards satisfying the childâ€™s basic need to face and overcome challenges. Based on the Scout Promise and Law, we provide life skills activities such as first-aid, knotting, outdoor cooking, hikes, camps and rock-climbing.

  

There are also proficiency and progress badges to be obtained, and these can be pursued based on personal interests. Our Cub Scouts program is dynamic and diverse, there's always something interesting to do!
