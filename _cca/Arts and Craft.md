Started with only 10 members in 2015, Art &amp; Craft Club has grown impressively to our current numbers of 60 members, under the supervision of our Art teachers.

  

Our club specially offers art making opportunity for students beyond the art curriculum. Giving them the exposure to experience art in many other ways. A great opportunity to groom pupils who are creative, passionate and have a penchant for Art.

Our aim is to provide exposure and appreciation to various mediums, materials and art forms. Also, to allow pupils to solve real life 21st century issues using art as a platform.

  

Members are also given opportunities to participate in art exhibitions such as the Singapore Youth Festival which will be held every 2 years and as well as decorating school events like our AIPS Appreciation Day.
