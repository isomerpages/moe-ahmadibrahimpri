The Vibrant Classroom Award is given to the classes in each level, that have the best decorations and learning corners. This new initiative was conducted in Term 1 from Weeks 4 to 6. 

The objective of this award is to inculcate a sense of ownership among students in creating a conducive learning environment. Students and Class Mentors worked together to design the class motto, mascots and decorations, according to the criteria.

A clean environment is conducive for learning. To encourage our students to take charge of their classroom cleanliness, our teachers carrying out classroom cleanliness checks from Term 2.
