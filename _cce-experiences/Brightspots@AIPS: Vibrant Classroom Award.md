The Vibrant Classroom Award is given to the classes in each level, that have the best decorations and learning corners. This new initiative was conducted in Term 1 from Weeks 4 to 6.Â 

The objective of this award is to inculcate a sense of ownership among students in creating a conducive learning environment. Students and Class Mentors worked together to design the class motto, mascots and decorations, according to the criteria.
