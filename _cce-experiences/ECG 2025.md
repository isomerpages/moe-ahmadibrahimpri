<h3><strong>Primary 6 ECG Talks 2025: Learning Beyond the Classroom</strong></h3>
<p>In Term 4, the CCE Department organised two meaningful Education and Career
Guidance (ECG) sessions for our Primary 6 students. These sessions aimed
to broaden students’ understanding of different pathways and encourage
them to make informed decisions about their future.</p>
<p>On <strong>28 October 2025</strong>, we were honoured to welcome <strong>Mr Danial Goh</strong>,
an alumnus of Ahmad Ibrahim Primary School and now a professional footballer.
He shared his educational journey, the challenges he faced, and the determination
that guided him towards both academic and athletic growth. Students were
inspired by his story and appreciated the opportunity to learn how passion,
discipline and resilience play an important role in achieving one’s goals.
A special highlight was the jersey giveaway, which brought much excitement
to the session.</p>
<p>In the following week, students attended a second ECG talk conducted by <strong>Ms Sajini</strong> from <strong>OLI@Mediacorp</strong>.
She provided valuable insights into career exploration and the pathways
that led her to the media industry. Through real-life experiences and practical
advice, she helped students understand how interests, strengths and opportunities
come together when considering future careers.</p>
<p>Both sessions were highly engaging, and students participated actively,
gaining a deeper appreciation of the diverse possibilities that lie ahead.
We thank our guest speakers for taking the time to inspire our students
and contribute to their learning beyond the classroom.</p>
