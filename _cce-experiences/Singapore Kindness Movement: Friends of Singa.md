**<u>Term 3</u>** <br>
Our students completed the mission 2 found in the kindsville Issue 3. For this mission, students learnt about the importance of practising kindness online and how to use T.H.I.N.K to reflect on the comments or posts before sharing them online. Through the mission, students show that they know how to show kindness online and are capable of writing kind and encouraging comments. This year students will only need to complete two missions to become a Friend of Singa. These missions will be revealed in Issue 1 and Issue 3 of Kindsville Times. Participating students will also stand a chance to have their entries featured in Issue 2 and Issue 4 of Kindsville Times.

**<u>Term 1 and Term 2</u>** <br>
For the first mission, students learnt more about path sharing between cyclists and pedestrians. They identified ways to be considerate users and also shared their past experiences of using the shared paths. Many students submitted their completed mission cards into the kindness mailbox and are halfway to becoming a Friend of Singa!
