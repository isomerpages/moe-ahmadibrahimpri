Friends of Singa (FOS) is a programme initiated by the Singapore Kindness Movement to encourage students to contribute beyond themselves and to the betterment of their surroundings. Through this programme, students can showcase and continue exemplifying kindness. 

This year, our school once again will be participating in the FOS project. The overarching theme would be on Understanding Diversity and the school’s focus would be on “Celebrating Diversity @ AIPS through Music, Dance or Martial Art.” 

One of the segments for this project will be a dance performance. A few dancers from the Malay, Chinese and India CCA groups will be selected to collaborate and showcase a fusion dance. This dance will be performed during Racial Harmony Day. 

The other segment would be a performance task carried out by the Primary Five students. They would work in groups and would need to pick a type of music, dance or martial art from a particular culture, and find out more about it. Then, they would need to teach students from another level about it and assess the learning of their learners. This would allow the Primary Five students and their ‘students’ to appreciate the diversity and the values that are exhibited from the various cultures that coexist in Singapore.

By promoting kindness through culture, we are able to create inclusive spaces, promote empathy and understanding, inspire positive change, nurture well-being and mental health, and encourage collaboration and cooperation among students. Embracing kindness in these domains will contribute to a more harmonious and compassionate society.
