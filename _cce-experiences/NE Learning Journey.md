#### Primary 5 NE show

The National Education (NE) Show returned in July this year after a two year hiatus. Our Primary Five students were enthralled to attend it on 2 July 2022, Saturday, which was right after the June holiday school break. The theme for this year’s NDP was “Stronger Together, Majulah!” The Total Defence Display shown was engaging, and made the students realise the lengths to which the The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) go to make Singapore safe for all of us. This experience was made even more meaningful as the knowledge of the various defence forces in Singapore is aligned to the Primary Five Social Studies syllabus. The entire experience of singing along to the National Day songs, enjoying hair-raising skydiving stunts by the Red Lions, watching the highly talented performers and witnessing the electrifying fireworks has definitely etched a riveting memory for the students.
