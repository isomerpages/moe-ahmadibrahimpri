#### Museum-Based Learning Journeys (MBLJs)

The Museum-Based Learning Journeys (MBLJs) are an integral part of our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme. They are designed to enhance students’ 21st Century Competencies, while enabling a more inclusive and authentic learning experience through lessons at Singapore’s museums and historical/ heritage sites.


P3 MBLJ to Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery (GSHG)

The Primary 3 students went to GSHG on 2, 25 and 30 July 2025. It was the first time our P3s embarked on a MBLJ. The programme began with a precinct walk through Geylang Serai Market and Food Centre, where students learned why this vibrant neighbourhood holds a special place in the hearts of the Malay community in Singapore. As they walked, they marvelled at the Malay architecture, traditions and products sold in the market/ food centre. At the gallery, the students gained valuable insights into the history of Geylang Serai and experienced traditional games and crafts. Through interactive displays and stories, they gained a deeper appreciation of how the Malay community has contributed to Singapore’s development over the years.

#### Primary 5 NE show 2023

Our Primary Five students were enthralled to attend it on 2 July 2023, Sunday, which was right after the June holiday school break. The theme for this year’s NDP was “Onward As One!” The Total Defence Display shown was engaging, and made the students realise the lengths to which the The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) go to make Singapore safe for all of us. This experience was made even more meaningful as the knowledge of the various defence forces in Singapore is aligned to the Primary Five Social Studies syllabus. The entire experience of singing along to the National Day songs, enjoying hair-raising skydiving stunts by the Red Lions, watching the highly talented performers and witnessing the electrifying fireworks has definitely etched a riveting memory for the students.
