Our Primary 6 students embarked on a service learning project in collaboration with All Saints Home Yishun, where they would prepare care packs for the residents.

Prior to the preparation of care packs, students learnt more about elders in elder care centers and our beneficiaries. The student leaders worked together to come up with a list of essential items to cater to the needs of the residents.

During the service learning, the students demonstrated great teamwork and the packing was completed in good time for delivery. A total of 180 care packs were delivered by the staff of AIPS to the Home. 

  

This service learning project provided students with the platform  to contribute back to the community and the opportunity to show care for those in need through their actions.
