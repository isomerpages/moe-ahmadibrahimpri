<p>World Kindness Day is an annual international observance on 13 November.
It was introduced in 1998 by the World Kindness Movement. Kindness Day
SG celebration is a key SG60 initiative by the Singapore Kindness Movement
(SKM) to remind Singaporeans to connect with others, show care and express
gratitude.</p>
<p>In support of Kindness Day SG, AIPS celebrated its inaugural AIPS Kindness
Day on 11 November 2025, in conjunction with Purple Parade. AIPS Kindness
Day aligns with the spirit of the Purple Parade, as we come together to
support inclusion and celebrate the abilities of Persons with Disabilities,
by spreading kindness to everyone around us and demonstrating our school
values of compassion and gratitude.</p>
<p>As part of their Social Studies lessons, students wrote heartfelt cards
to Singa. These cards were a meaningful way for students to tell him about
challenges, kind acts they have seen or heard, and to show gratitude to
those who have made a positive impact on them.&nbsp; The cards were then
posted in the Kindness Mailbox located in the school canteen. Furthermore,
the SS teachers screened ‘Maju-Lah!’ - a moving new short film series written
by SKM, with the Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB), in celebration
of SG60. These short films highlighted how kindness has stayed meaningful
and relevant through the years and how the values of care, connection,
and contribution have helped build our nation.</p>
<p>In addition to the classroom activities, various recess fringe activities
were also prepared for the students. There were games booths, a colouring
station, display board showing P5’s students’ handmade posters on their
interpretations of cyberkindness. Students participated in the various
activities actively. It has indeed been a meaningful day of learning for
one and all!&nbsp;</p>
