On 18 November 2021, our students came together as a class to clean up their classrooms in preparation for the next school year.&nbsp;

Assisted by their class mentors, students wiped their desks, and chairs with their own rag, cleared their lockers and separated their trash for recycling purposes.&nbsp;

The Use-Your-Hands campaign aims to instill a greater sense of responsibility in students to maintain the cleanliness and tidiness of their learning spaces.

  

A clean place is a safe place for meaningful learning to take place!
