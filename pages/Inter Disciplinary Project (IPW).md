At Ahmad Ibrahim Primary School, we adopt an inter-disciplinary approach to learning touted to boost engagement and bring coherence to the school experiences that students enjoy each day. Guided by the Design Thinking Process, our Totally Outrageous Day (TOD) Project Work serves to provide students with an authentic learning platform where they are given the opportunity to synthesise knowledge from various areas of learning and then proceed to critically and creatively apply it to real-world situations. In doing so, students are set to develop 21st Century Competencies such as Confidence, Cooperation, Curiosity, Creativity as well as Cultural and Environmental Awareness.

Through this inter-disciplinary experience, students not only learn to make meaning of their individual and shared knowledge, they also learn to be an effective team player while honing their communication skills and developing themselves as self-directed learners. Teachers function as guides and facilitators, throughout the whole TOD Project Work process, providing constructive feedback and advice when necessary. Upon completion, both teachers and students take time to reflect on their TOD journey and thought processes.
