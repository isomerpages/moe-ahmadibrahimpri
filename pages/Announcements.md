#### Teachers' Day 2023

AIPS is celebrating Teachers’ Day on Thursday, 31 Aug 2023. Former students of AIPS, if you plan to visit your teachers, you may do so from 10.45 am to 1.00 pm.  

You are strongly encouraged to make prior arrangements with your teachers to inform them of your visits as school ends early by 10.30am and they may leave school soon after if they are not aware of your visits.  

As the school will be used as a Polling Station for the upcoming Presidential Election, all former students are to strictly vacate AIPS by 1.00pm sharp to facilitate the setup.  

Please register yourself at the security guard post when you arrive at school.  Thank you for your cooperation and we wish you a meaningful visit.
