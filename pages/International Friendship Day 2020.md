On 13 April 2020, schools in Singapore commemorated the annual International Friendship Day (IFD). However, this year is rather unique as IFD fell during the Circuit Breaker period, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, our AIPS students had to discover more about ASEAN countries and their cultures via the online Student Learning Space (SLS) platform.

In line with the theme ‘Beyond Borders’, our CCE team designed a comprehensive and customised SLS lesson packages for our students. The packages included quizzes, trivia on the 10 ASEAN countries and highlighted philatelic stamps that featured the ASEAN countries in a fun and interesting way. For the first time, our students were treated to interview recordings of our teachers who had taught in China, Vietnam, the Philippines and even the USA! It was an eye opener to learn about school life in other countries as compared to Singapore.

The CCE team also included the Kindsville Times newsletter by the Singapore Kindness Movement in the IFD lesson packages. The activities included colouring, flag designing and writing aspirations for ASEAN. Our students were given a period of two weeks to complete the packages, which they managed to share with their family members. With opportunities to post questions and have their queries answered online, it was a memorable IFD learning experience indeed.
