Racial Harmony Day (RHD) in AIPS was commemorated on the 13th of July this year with the theme ‘Multicultural Singapore’. Racial Harmony Day is held every year to remind us of the communal riots that happened on the 21st of July 1964 between the Malays and the Chinese. This historical event instils in Singaporeans the importance of maintaining racial and religious harmony in our multicultural and multi-ethnic society. The RHD team of CCE teachers conducted a live-presentation for the school via video-conferencing on the significance of RHD and shared valuable information on Chinese, Malay, and Indian cultures such as their ethnic costumes, dances, and festivals. Quizzes were then open to students to test their understanding of the information shared. To capture the vibrancy of the event, class mentors took pictures of their students in traditional ethnic wear. Students learnt the importance of preserving racial harmony by appreciating people of different races and their cultural practices. They were encouraged to befriend others of different race or religion, treat everyone equally, and appreciate the different cultures in Singapore. As a follow-up activity, an SLS lesson package was designed for students to explore RHD at their own convenience.
