Teachers of the English department came together to organize a variety of fun-filled and meaningful activities in an effort to promote the love of the English language. Students were provided with the opportunity to learn through play as they immersed themselves in various fascinating activities.

On top of that, captivating contests and quizzes such as the Caption Contest, order of adjectives paper plate activity (P1-P2) sparked much interest in the students’ passion for the English Language. Even our teachers had their share of fun in the Teachers’ Caption Contests! The winners for the top three entries in each level were awarded prizes.

What better way to learn than through doing and playing games? Level-based activities such as mystery guest readers, Picture reveal, were carried out during English lessons in that week. Students had a ball of time as they explored the English language in a fun and exciting way!

English Week is never complete without a Character Parade! Everyone in school, including teachers, was encouraged to come dressed up according to their level theme. The range of costume themes from students' favourite books added vibrancy to the atmosphere in school on that day.

  

It was truly an educational English Week at AIPS!

<p><strong>Lower Primary Strategies:</strong></p>
			<p><img alt="Lower Primary Strategies" src="/images/STELLAR_chart_LP1.png"></p>
			<p>The Lower Primary STELLAR Pedagogical Model consists of three features for the development of a strong foundation in EL namely:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Shared Book Approach (SBA)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learning Centre Activities (LC)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>Shared Book Approach (SBA)</strong> aims to develop the love for reading and to explicitly teach the language items, structures and skills through word study as well as phonics, grammar, vocabulary and drama. Out of 29 books available, the school has carefully picked out a range of titles to expose the students to a variety of stories and themes that will engage them in the learning of the English Language. Students will be given accompanying learning sheets for each title so that they can practice the various skills taught.</p>
<p>The <strong>Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)</strong> allows for the provision of scaffolding and guidance on the part of the teachers so that the shared experience attained during the SBA can be further developed and translated into group as well as individual writing. The Learning Centre Activities will promote differentiated learning among the students in the class so as to enhance literacy skills like reading and listening.</p>
<p><strong>Upper Primary Strategies:</strong></p>

<p>The Upper Primary STELLAR Pedagogical Model consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Supported Reading (SR)</li>
<li>Know-Want to Know-Learnt (KWL) </li>
<li>Writing Process Cycle (WPC) </li>
<li>Retelling (RT) </li>
<li>Differentiated Instruction (DI)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Supported Reading (SR)</strong> provides a bridge between teacher supported reading aloud and independent silent reading. It provides opportunities for students to make predictions, read assigned section silently, discuss the text and difficult words as a whole class, led by the teacher. The strategy is usually carried out for narrative and information texts.</p>
<p><strong>Know-Want to Know-Learnt (KWL)</strong> is used mainly for non-fiction texts such as information reports. This strategy helps students to extract information and relate it to what they already know about the topic. Teachers guide students to organise, access and remember information. This enables students to understand and follow the logic of information presented in a text, recognise information that is repeated and distinguish between main ideas and details. The teacher’s support is gradually reduced as the students learn to be more independent in extracting information they need.</p>
<p><strong>Writing Process Cycle (WPC)</strong> is built from the principles of the MLEA taught at the lower primary level. It continues to provide students with guidance in the processes of planning, writing and reviewing before they apply these skills in writing, independently. At the Upper Primary, the focus is more on the creative aspects of writing and encouraging the voice of the young writer.</p>
<p><strong>Retelling (RT)</strong> is a reading comprehension strategy that engages students at different levels of language from interpreting meaning at the whole text level, to individual words and phrases and back to the whole text again. It provides opportunities for students to engage in a whole range of important language and cognitive processes including recall of events/information, main points and characters, text structures and language features. It also provides opportunities for all of the major language skills to be applied – listening, reading and viewing as well as speaking, representing and writing – as students actively make meaning of texts and share their understanding with their peers.</p>
<p><strong>Differentiated Instruction (DI)</strong> provides students with differentiated support at various points of instruction to optimise their learning. Appropriate activities are designed to support, reinforce and extend their learning.</p>

    <div>
      <p>To ensure that all students are able to read independently according to their appropriate reading age, various literacy support programmes are being implemented by the department to support students at the lower primary and mid primary levels.</p>
<p>These include the Learning Support Programme (LSP), School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR), Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) and Pullout programme at the upper primary levels.</p>

<hr>
<p>PEAR TREES is a strategy that students can use in their daily conversations. It helps students focus on how they pronounce their words, express themselves clearly and expand on their ideas that they share with others. It can also help students to converse with their teacher on any particular topic.</p>
<p><img alt="PEAR TREES" src="/images/pear%20trees.png"></p>
<h3 id="annotation-for-reading-comprehension">Annotation for reading comprehension</h3>
<hr>
<p>At AIPS, students are taught annotating skills. Annotating a text can help students understand difficult material better and encourage active reading. Porter-O’Donnell (2004) suggested that students be given a bookmark each that detailed ideas for symbols to use in annotation and the types of comments they could make. Thus, a set of teacher-designed guidelines for the annotation of narrative texts is carefully crafted. This set of guidelines, which is made into a bookmark, is to help guide the students as they make their thinking visible. There is a common language and understanding for annotation among the students and the teacher. Students are strongly encouraged to use these symbols until they are able to establish their own preferred annotation styles and modes over time.</p>

    <label for="accordion6">Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)</label>
    <div>
      <p>The main pedagogical approach adopted in teaching English is STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading). The Modified Language Experience (MLEA) is one of the three approaches adopted in teaching English at the lower primary levels. Following Shared Book Reading, MLEA comprises a shared experience that is linked to the Big Book that has been currently read. Some of these shared experiences include students making sandwiches, blowing bubbles and growing caterpillars. These shared experiences provide both the context and content for students to practise the four language skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing. With instructional scaffolding from the teacher, students think, talk, read and write about their experiences as they are guided through to make the connections between oral and written language.</p>
<p>As it centers on personal experiences and is based on self-generated vocabulary and grammar by students, MLEA is highly learner-centered. It is also aligned to the Shared Book Approach’s focus on the reading process while integrating it with writing, speaking, and listening.</p>
<p>A typical MLEA lesson spans over three days as students navigate from Class Writing (MLEA 1) to Group Writing (MLEA 2) to Individual Writing (MLEA 3). With the aid of the teacher who transcribes their oral input, students first come up with a piece of class writing. This becomes the basis for group writing, when students collaborate in small mixed ability groups before they go on to individual writing.</p>

    <label for="accordion7">Learning Centres</label>
    <div>
      <p>Learning Centres are designated areas in the classroom where small groups of children at similar progress levels can gather for the reinforcement and extension of Shared Book Approach (SBA) and Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA) lessons. Once the teacher has demonstrated to your pupils how to use these centres, they can work there independently while the teacher focuses on a group that needs further specific instruction.</p>
<p>Teachers use various types of Learning Centres for different purposes, but for STELLAR classes in Primary One and Two, there would be a Listening Centre, a Reading Centre and a Word Study Centre. Each centre is supplied with appropriate materials and equipment to facilitate independent activities that provide opportunities for the children to use the language skills they have acquired during the preceding unit's work. In addition to practising their language skills, proper use of the Learning Centres helps children develop generic social skills for group interaction such as co-operation, respect for others and responsibility while fostering independence from the teacher.</p>
<p>Sessions in the three Learning Centres provide valuable practice and extension of all of the language skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing. Successful implementation of these sessions at the end of each SBA/MLEA Unit reinforces and complements the language teaching and learning opportunities that precede them.</p>

<p>To end their school term with a bang, the Primary One and Two students participated in various activities such as Charades, postcard writing, acrostic poem writing and crossword puzzles which were based on their STELLAR big books - <em>The Broken Bangle</em> (P1) and <em>Roti Prata</em> (P2). The students had a lot of fun that week and thought it was the best way to end the school term!</p>
