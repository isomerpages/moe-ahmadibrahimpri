#### Music: The AIPS Approach
In AIPS, we adopt the ECA approach in our music teaching.

**E** – Experience <br>
**C** – Concept <br>
**A** – Application <br>

On top of ECA, we also include elements of the Kodaly Approach.



#### Music Curriculum at AIPS
At Ahmad Ibrahim Primary School, we strongly believe that ‘Every child is a star’. Through Music lessons, students listen and learn to recognise different types of music. They are exposed to music pieces which reflect different moods and from different cultures. They sing and play melodic and rhythmic instruments individually or in groups, and explore putting different sounds together.


#### Primary 1: Singing and Body Percussion

Children enjoy singing and dancing to music. It is also one of the fundamental skills for music lessons. Thus, in Primary 1, our students learn to use their “singing voice” and to sing using the correct techniques. Students are introduced to various genre of music of different cultures and languages.


#### Primary 2: Kompang
	
Our students are introduced to the Kompang, a hand drum commonly used in traditional music.

#### Primary 3: Recorder

The Primary 3 students will start to learn the fundamentals of playing the recorder. Recorder is the main melodic instrument used in our school and we hope that our students will be able to master it well under the guidance of our music teachers.
