<h4>Vision</h4>
<hr>
<p>Lifelong passion and appreciation towards music.</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<hr>
<p>Promote appreciation of music through quality and diverse experiences.</p>
<h4>Music: The AIPS Approach</h4>
<p>In AIPS, we adopt the ECA approach in our music teaching.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> – Experience
<br><strong>C</strong> – Concept
<br><strong>A</strong> – Application
<br>
</p>
<p>On top of ECA, we also include elements of the Kodaly Approach.</p>
<h4>Music Curriculum at AIPS</h4>
<p>At Ahmad Ibrahim Primary School, we strongly believe that ‘Every child
is a star’. Through Music lessons, students listen and learn to recognise
different types of music. They are exposed to music pieces which reflect
different moods and from different cultures. They sing and play melodic
and rhythmic instruments individually or in groups, and explore putting
different sounds together.</p>
<h4>Primary 1: Singing and Body Percussion</h4>
<p>Children enjoy singing and dancing to music. It is also one of the fundamental
skills for music lessons. Thus, in Primary 1, our students learn to use
their “singing voice” and to sing using the correct techniques. Students
are introduced to various genre of music of different cultures and languages.</p>
<h4>Primary 2: Kompang</h4>
<p>Our students are introduced to the Kompang, a hand drum commonly used
in traditional music.</p>

<h4>Primary 3: Recorder</h4>
<p>The Primary 3 students will start to learn the fundamentals of playing
the recorder. Recorder is the main melodic instrument used in our school
and we hope that our students will be able to master it well under the
guidance of our music teachers.</p>

<h4>Primary 4: Ukulele and Recorder</h4>
<p>Our students have the opportunity of learning how to play the Ukulele
in Primary 4. This is to ensure our students get the exposure to different
types of instruments. The students will also continue with recorder playing
as part of the music curriculum.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Primary 5: GarageBand</h4>
<p>The Primary 5 students infused Information and Communications Technology
(ICT) into their music lesson. They are introduced to GarageBand. Using
the app, they can showcase their creativity by arranging a song using the
smart instruments and loops.</p>
<h4>Primary 6: Drumming</h4>
<p>As a post-PSLE activity, the students learn how to play different rhythms
on various drums. The students had fun exploring rhythms and learnt about
teamwork and cooperation.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Shine at AIPS 2023</h4>
<p>Shine at AIPS is a music competition held virtually this year. The objective
of this competition is to provide students with a platform to showcase
their talent, and allow them to build stage confidence. This competition
is open to all students. They could choose from the following categories:
Dance, Instrument, or Voice.
