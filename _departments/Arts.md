#### Mission
----

To provide quality experiences that promote students' awareness and passion for the Arts.

---
At Ahmad Ibrahim Primary School, we strongly believe that ‘Every child is a star’. The Art programmes are developed to help students learn to observe their surroundings, identify and describe the colours, shapes and texture of the things they see. They share their thoughts and feelings about these observations through artwork, discussion and writing. They learn to use different materials and media to create the artworks. We want our students to enjoy looking at and creating art and to have opportunities to showcase their artworks.




#### 2024 P6 Canva Art 
Our Primary 6 students are given the exciting opportunity to experiment with AI tools within the Canva application to craft their unique juxtaposition artworks. Alongside experiencing Canva's AI capabilities, students delve into the platform's wide array of editing tools and libraries tailored for their use. Through this hands-on experience, students learn to expertly edit, layer, and experiment with various compositions, honing their skills to create stunning juxtaposition artworks.
