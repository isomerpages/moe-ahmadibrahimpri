This was our SEP Programme for Primary One and Two, Gymnastics Explore and Play respectively. This programme allows the pupils to experience what gymnastics is. There are a few benefits for pupils who do gymnastics. It increases the coordination and flexibility of the child and it also helps to develop strong, healthy bones, which is important to develop at a young age.

The pupils had a great time learning the different moves and would always look forward to the programme.
