**Cyber Wellness Education**

We have an innovative Cyber Wellness programme to educate our students from Primary 1 onwards, advocating the Cyber Wellness principles of “Safe and Responsible Use” and “Respect for Self and Others” as well as the 3-step approach “Sense”, “Think” and “Act”.

The key purpose of AIPS’ Cyber Wellness Programme is to provide a holistic cyber wellness education, addressing concerns of online safety, security and well-being of our students when using modern technologies and understanding the potential dangers of harmful online behaviours and be aware of how to protect oneself from them.

The main topics covered in our cyber wellness education include Netiquette, Dangers with Cyber Contacts, Cyber bullying, Handling Inappropriate Content, Games Addiction and Copyright.

**Term 2 Cyber Wellness Assembly: Empowering Students Through Awareness**

This term, our Cyber Wellness Ambassadors took center stage to promote safe and responsible online behaviour to their fellow school mates. After undergoing specialized training with a professional drama instructor, they crafted an engaging and informative performance focused on key cyber wellness topics such as *Responsible online usage* and *Scam awareness*.
The interactive performance not only educated students about potential cyber risks but also encouraged them to be vigilant and kind digital citizens. By using drama as a medium, the ambassadors made the presentation more relatable and memorable.

We commend our Cyber Wellness Ambassadors for their dedication and creativity in spreading awareness and helping to build a safer online environment for all!  

*Stay Smart. Stay Safe. Stay Kind—Online!* 💻
