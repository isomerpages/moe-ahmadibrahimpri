**Cyber Wellness Education**

We have an innovative Cyber Wellness programme to educate our students from Primary 1 onwards, advocating the Cyber Wellness principles of “Safe and Responsible Use” and “Respect for Self and Others” as well as the 3-step approach “Sense”, “Think” and “Act”.

The key purpose of AIPS’ Cyber Wellness Programme is to provide a holistic cyber wellness education, addressing concerns of online safety, security and well-being of our students when using modern technologies and understanding the potential dangers of harmful online behaviours and be aware of how to protect oneself from them.

The main topics covered in our cyber wellness education include Netiquette, Dangers with Cyber Contacts, Cyber bullying, Handling Inappropriate Content, Games Addiction and Copyright.
