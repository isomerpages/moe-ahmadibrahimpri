<p><strong>Cyber Wellness Education</strong>
</p>
<p>We have an innovative Cyber Wellness programme to educate our students
from Primary 1 onwards, advocating the Cyber Wellness principles of “Safe
and Responsible Use” and “Respect for Self and Others” as well as the 3-step
approach “Sense”, “Think” and “Act”.</p>
<p>The key purpose of AIPS’ Cyber Wellness Programme is to provide a holistic
cyber wellness education, addressing concerns of online safety, security
and well-being of our students when using modern technologies and understanding
the potential dangers of harmful online behaviours and be aware of how
to protect oneself from them.</p>
<p>The main topics covered in our cyber wellness education include Netiquette,
Dangers with Cyber Contacts, Cyber bullying, Handling Inappropriate Content,
Games Addiction and Copyright.</p>

<p><strong>Term 2 Cyber Wellness Assembly: Empowering Students Through Awareness</strong>
</p>
<p>This term, our Cyber Wellness Ambassadors took center stage to promote
safe and responsible online behaviour to their fellow school mates. After
undergoing specialized training with a professional drama instructor, they
crafted an engaging and informative performance focused on key cyber wellness
topics such as <em>Responsible online usage</em> and <em>Scam awareness</em>.
The interactive performance not only educated students about potential
cyber risks but also encouraged them to be vigilant and kind digital citizens.
By using drama as a medium, the ambassadors made the presentation more
relatable and memorable.</p>
<p>We commend our Cyber Wellness Ambassadors for their dedication and creativity
in spreading awareness and helping to build a safer online environment
for all!</p>
<p><em>Stay Smart. Stay Safe. Stay Kind—Online!</em> 💻</p>
