**New Media Literacy @AIPS**
		
New Media Literacy @AIPS
New media literacies refer to the skills, competencies, and capacities required to effectively navigate, critically evaluate, and participate in the digital and media-rich environments of the modern world. As technology and media continue to evolve rapidly, being digitally literate is essential for individuals to engage with information and communication effectively and responsibly.

In AIPS, we emphasize on Curate, Create and Connect as the main ways of interacting in the digital networked environment. Regular engagement in these interactions will enable students to develop an understanding of the social practices governing the digital networked environment.

School programmes are designed to provide students with critical 21st Century Competencies: Communication, Collaboration, and Information domains. The school also work towards standards and benchmarks to be achieved when a student graduates at end of primary 6.
