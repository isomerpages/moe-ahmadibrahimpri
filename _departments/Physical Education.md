#### Primary 5 Outdoor Education Camp @Labrador OALC

Our Primary 5 students recently embarked on an exciting Outdoor Education Camp at the Labrador Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre (OALC). This memorable experience allowed them to immerse themselves in nature, build character, and develop essential life skills.

The camp featured a range of activities, including high and low elements, orienteering, and team-building challenges. These activities encouraged students to embrace teamwork, resilience, and perseverance while pushing themselves beyond their comfort zones.

In a supportive environment, students were inspired to strive for excellence and foster a lifelong love for learning. They also deepened their appreciation for the natural world, strengthened friendships, and embraced values such as responsibility, respect, and determination.

This enriching experience was a journey of growth, confidence, and connectionâ€”a highlight of their educational journey.
