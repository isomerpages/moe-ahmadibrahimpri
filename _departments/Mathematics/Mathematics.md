## Mathematics Framework

The programmes in the Mathematics curriculum are planned based on the national mathematics framework as shown below. The central focus of the framework is mathematical problem solving. The framework sets the direction for and provides guidance in the teaching, learning, and assessment of mathematics. It also reflects the 21st century competencies.

## Learning Support

We believe that all children can learn given the right learning support.

In AIPS, we have the Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) at the Primary 1 level and Primary 2 level and Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN) programme from Primary 3 level to Primary 6 level.

LSM provides early intervention to Primary 1 and 2 students with weak basic numeracy skills.
The programme focuses on basic mathematical skills and concepts to build good foundation.
It aims to build studentsâ€™ confidence and positive beliefs about their ability to do Math.
The important feature of LSM is that students receive more individual attention from the teacher as the class size is small.

The ICAN programme seeks to support teachers of low progress students from the Primary 3 to Primary 6 level to improve students' confidence and achievements in Mathematics. Teachers taking the ICAN classes are trained in ICAN principles which comprise of both general strategies and topic-specified strategies that will aid them in supporting our students. Similar to the LSM programme, the class size is smaller than that of the mainstream classes to allow teachers to pay more attention to our low progress students.</p>
