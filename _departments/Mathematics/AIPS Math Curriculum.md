<h4><strong><u>Use of manipulatives </u></strong></h4>
<p>At AIPS, we believe that learning mathematics should be an engaging and
hands-on experienceã€‚ One<a href="http://experience.One" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> </a>of the key strategies we employ to achieve
this is the use of manipulatives in our mathematics teaching. Manipulatives
provide a concrete way for students to understand mathematical concepts.
For instance, by using base ten blocks, students can physically construct
numbers, allowing them to see the structure of place value rather than
just memorising it. Apart from enhancing conceptual understanding, it helps
to foster greater motivation and and increase student engagement. It also
supports diverse learning styles, especially tactile learners.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Use of ICT </u></strong></h4>
<p>Students Learning Space (SLS) is an online learning portal, a key initiative
from MOE, that promotes self-directed learning and collaboration among
students. Apart from SLS, our school subscribes to KooBits, a Singapore-based
gamified e-learning platform, and every student in AIPS has an account
that they can use in school and at home. Termly prizes are given to classes
and individual students for achieving the highest score. In addition, various
other virtual platforms are also used in class to engage our students and
enrich their learning.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Math Mania </u></strong></h4>
<p>Math Mania is a school-wide programme. For Primary 1 to 3, they will be
engaged in solving Sudoku puzzles while the Primary 4 to 6 students will
be solving Ken Ken Puzzles. The aim of this programme is to develop logical
thinking skills and problem-solving skills. By solving these puzzles, the
students are introduced to a structured challenge that requires analytical
thinking and deductive reasoning. At the same time, we want to promote
the joy of learning in mathematics and cultivate perseverance in the students
as they navigate through the process of solving these puzzles. To make
it even more fun, we organize intra-class and inter-class competitions
and students get to win prizes and medals.</p>
