<p><strong>Culinary Mathematics at AIPS</strong> is an interdisciplinary,
experiential learning programme that brings together the precision of mathematics
and the creativity of culinary tasks. It provides students with authentic
opportunities to apply mathematical concepts in real-world contexts, making
learning both tangible and meaningful. Through hands-on culinary experiences,
students deepen their conceptual understanding of fractions, factors, and
measurement while developing essential life skills.</p>
<p>The programme is thoughtfully structured across levels to ensure progressive
learning:</p>
<h4>Primary 2 Fractions Slice N Learn</h4>
<p>Students begin with simple yet enjoyable tasks such as slicing their own
bread into equal parts and spreading different toppings. This introduces
them to the concept of equal sharing in a concrete and relatable way.</p>
