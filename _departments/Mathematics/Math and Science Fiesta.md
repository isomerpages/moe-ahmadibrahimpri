The Math and Science Fiesta is an annual post-PSLE tradition at AIPS which provides an excellent platform for our graduating students to apply their creative thinking and inventive skills through designing a myriad of games for their juniors to play. The games not only have to be engaging and fun, but also need to have Mathematics and Science concepts infused. The juniors have plenty of fun trying out the games as they challenge their knowledge of Mathematics and Science concepts. It is indeed a wonderful celebration of learning for everyone.
