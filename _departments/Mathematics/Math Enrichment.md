The Mathematics enrichment initiative aims to nurture the higher-ability students.

For Primary 2 and 3 selected students, the Mathematics enrichment programme run by the vendor aims to strengthen mathematical concepts, promote critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills and develop creative thinking using Magic, Puzzles, Games, Project, Paper Craft and Card Tricks.

At present, we have identified Singapore Kangaroo Math Contest (SMKC), National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS) and International Competitions and Assessments for Schools (ICAS) Mathematics to provide opportunities for selected P3 to P6 high readiness learners to participate.

We also offer Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics for selected P4 to P6 students as an enrichment programme. The aim is to develop students' mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. They will have opportunities to work independently or collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles, games and mathematical explorations specially designed for this programme.
