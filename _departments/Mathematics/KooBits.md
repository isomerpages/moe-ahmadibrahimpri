<p>All Primary 1 to 6 students are provided access to KooBits, a Mathematics
learning portal that empowers students to be self-directed students who
learn independently with minimal teacher supervision. Focusing on positive
reinforcement and motivation, KooBits facilitates interactive, effective
and fun learning through collaboration, competitive games and rewards such
as badges and virtual credits. With the increase in repetitive practices,
students acquire proficiency and mastery of the skill taught in class.</p>
