We believe that all children can learn given the right learning support.

In AIPS, we have the Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) at the Primary 1 level to Primary 4 level.

LSM provides early intervention to Primary 1 to 4 students with weak basic numeracy skills.
The programme focuses on basic mathematical skills and concepts to build good foundation.
It aims to build studentsâ€™ confidence and positive beliefs about their ability to do Math.
The important feature of LSM is that students receive more individual attention from the teacher as the class size is small.
