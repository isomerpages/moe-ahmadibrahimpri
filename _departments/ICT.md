### School ICT Approach

		
#### Information Technology for Learning and Teaching
		
**IT for Collaboration and Self-directed Learning**
		
IT is embedded in the curriculum and pupils use Information and Communication Technology tools for collaboration and self-directed learning. These tools include web 2.0 technologies such as Google sites, Google documents, etc. Teachers also use online forums and communication technologies to engage students in deeper discussions of concepts and developments.

**Robotics Club**
		
Students who have an interest or talent in IT can join the school Robotics clubs to explore using technologies in their projects and participate in national competitions. These students can look forward to enhancing their skills to the next level and also take advantage of available platforms to learn from talented peers.

### Cyber Wellness

We have an innovative Cyber Wellness programme to educate our students from Primary 1 onwards, advocating the Cyber Wellness principles of “Safe and Responsible Use” and “Respect for Self and Others” as well as the 3-step approach “Sense”, “Think” and “Act”.
