<p><strong>Reading Circles</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>Reading Circles (RC) is a provision for advanced readers who are ready
to read more widely, deeply and critically.</p>
<p>Based on the instructional approach of reader response, RC aims to engage
advanced readers to help them extend their experience of the world through
exposure to a range of age-appropriate rich texts (fiction and non-fiction).
Through collective inquiry and the cultivation of an active inquiring stance
to reading , readers are encouraged to respond with authentic connections
to the texts and their worlds they meet, and to develop capacity for imagination,
perspective-taking and empathy.</p>
<p>Resources for RC are designed as modules, and each module is constructed
around one fiction text. The reading modules vary in pitch and difficulty
to cater to a range of verbal talents.</p>
