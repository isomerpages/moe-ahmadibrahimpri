### ELIAS- English Language Interests All Students and Staff

Teachers of the English department come together every term to organize a variety of fun-filled and meaningful activities to promote the love of the English language. 
Students are provided with the opportunity to learn through play as they immerse themselves in various fascinating activities like language games, contests and quizzes. Activities such as Mystery Guest Readers, bring much excitement as students look forward to teachers coming into their classrooms dressed up as book characters to read them a book. Students have a ball of time as they explore the English language in a fun and exciting way! 

English Week is never complete without a Character Parade! Everyone in school, including teachers, are encouraged to come dressed up as book characters. Books truly come alive that day!
