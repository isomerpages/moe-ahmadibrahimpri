### ELIAS- English Language Interests All Students and Staff

Teachers of the English department came together to organize a variety of fun-filled and meaningful activities in an effort to promote the love of the English language. Students were provided with the opportunity to learn through play as they immersed themselves in various fascinating activities.
On top of that, captivating contests and quizzes such as the Caption Contest, order of adjectives paper plate activity (P1-P2) sparked much interest in the students’ passion for the English Language. Even our teachers had their share of fun in the Teachers’ Caption Contests! The winners for the top three entries in each level were awarded prizes.
What better way to learn than through doing and playing games? Level-based activities such as mystery guest readers, Picture reveal, were carried out during English lessons in that week. Students had a ball of time as they explored the English language in a fun and exciting way!
English Week is never complete without a Character Parade! Everyone in school, including teachers, was encouraged to come dressed up according to their level theme. The range of costume themes from students' favourite books added vibrancy to the atmosphere in school on that day.
It was truly an educational English Week at AIPS!

NLB - Read For Books Charity Drive

Read for Books is a charity book drive with the intention of raising awareness of reading and share the gift of reading with the less privileged. From 11 to 26 July 2020, for every 10 people who read for 15 minutes, one book will be donated to selected beneficiaries. That year, we were able to raise 95 books for charity.
