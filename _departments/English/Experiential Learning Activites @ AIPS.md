### Experiential Learning @ AIPS

Our school believes in providing students with a rich learning experience. Students in different levels engage in various hands-on activities and learning journeys where they learn by doing. Such experiences deepen their understanding and help them make connections between what they learn in the classroom to real-world situations. These shared experiences provide both the context and content for students to practise the four language skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing. 

##### **Primary 1:**

1. Mooncake Making 

Tied in with the Stellar unit ‘Mid-Autum Festival’, students work together with others while listening to and following instructions to make their own mooncakes.

Visit to Gardens by The Bay

Students learnt about and saw carnivorous plants like the pitcher plant, venus flytrap and butterwort at Gardens By The Bay. The experience deepened their learning of the Stellar unit ‘Unusual Plants’ and also helped to cement concepts about plants taught during science lessons.
