### Experiential Learning @ AIPS

Our school believes in providing students with a rich learning experience. Students in different levels engage in various hands-on activities and learning journeys where they learn by doing. Such experiences deepen their understanding and help them make connections between what they learn in the classroom to real-world situations. These shared experiences provide both the context and content for students to practise the four language skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing. 

##### **Primary 1:**

1. Mooncake Making 

Tied in with the Stellar unit ‘Mid-Autum Festival’, students work together with others while listening to and following instructions to make their own mooncakes.

##### **Primary2:**

1.	S’mores and Hipster Prata Making:

Students tried their hand at making s’more and hipster pratas after the Stellar units ‘A Day in The Kitchen With Grandma’ and ‘Roti Prata’. Students later used vocabulary learnt to write personal recounts of their experiences.

##### **Primary 3:**

Visit to Gardens by The Bay

Students learnt about and saw carnivorous plants like the pitcher plant, venus flytrap and butterwort at Gardens By The Bay. The experience deepened their learning of the Stellar unit ‘Unusual Plants’ and also helped to cement concepts about plants taught during science lessons.

##### **Primary 4:**

1.	Ice Cream Making:

Our P4 students made their very own ice cream during their English Language lesson! Through this authentic learning experience, our students made the procedural text of ‘Making Ice Cream’ come alive. They followed the steps in the text, worked together and made their own ice cream. Great teamwork and patience paid off with them enjoying the sweet treat at the end.

2. Jurassic Mile @AIPS:

Students took part in and English Language Escape Room activity, Jurassic Mile@AIPS in August. This activity is an extension of what students had learnt in the STELLAR Unit, ‘Dinosaurs Exist’. Besides reviewing the vocabulary and grammar structures learnt, students were also challenged to use their communication and problem-solving skills.
