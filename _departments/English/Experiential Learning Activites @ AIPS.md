<h3>Experiential Learning @ AIPS</h3>
<p>Our school believes in providing students with a rich learning experience.
Students in different levels engage in various hands-on activities and
learning journeys where they learn by doing. Such experiences deepen their
understanding and help them make connections between what they learn in
the classroom to real-world situations. These shared experiences provide
both the context and content for students to practise the four language
skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing.</p>

cement concepts about plants taught during science lessons.</p>

<p>Our P4 students made their very own ice cream during their English Language
lesson! Through this authentic learning experience, our students made the
procedural text of ‘Making Ice Cream’ come alive. They followed the steps
in the text, worked together and made their own ice cream. Great teamwork
and patience paid off with them enjoying the sweet treat at the end.</p>

communication and problem-solving skills.</p>
