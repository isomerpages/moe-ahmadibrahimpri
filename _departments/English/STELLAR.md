#### STELLAR

Our P4 students made their very own ice cream during their English Language lesson! Through this authentic learning experience, our students made the procedural text of 'Making Ice Cream' come alive. They followed the steps in the text, worked together and made their own ice cream. Great teamwork and patience paid off with them enjoying the sweet treat at the end.
