### Reading Culture @ AIPS

To build a pervasive reading culture and develop positive life-long reading habits in our students, the school has in place various initiatives to nurture children who love reading. 

**1. Sustained Silent Reading, Extensive Reading and Library Periods**
Students are given the time to read for pleasure in class and in the school library and have access to a wide range of popular hard copy books and e-books. E-books also provide beginning readers with support through its ‘Read To Me’ function.

**2.	Book promotions and Meet-the-Author Assembly sessions :**

Students in the school are introduced to new books and encouraged to read through activities like our Mystery Guest Reader pre-assembly programme, book reading conducted in the library by parent volunteers and mass borrowing sessions. Students also get to meet and listen to local authors during our Meet-the-Author assembly sessions.

The whole school reads together every year in ‘Read For Books’, a charity book drive. In 2024, the whole school read together to donate a total of 100 books to the less privileged.

**4.	Little Red Dot Newspaper Subscription:**

Primary 5 and 6 students subscribe to The Little Red Dot, a weekly publication by The Straits Times which curates contemporary articles for students. The Little Red Dot engages visual learners with lots of illustrations, graphics and photographs and encourages critical thinking and analysis.
