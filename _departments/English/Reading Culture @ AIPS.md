### Reading Culture @ AIPS

To build a pervasive reading culture and develop positive life-long reading habits in our students, the school has in place a Reading Programme to nurture pupils who love reading. Students are encouraged to read widely through book promotions and easy access to hardcopy and e-books. Our school library is regularly restocked with books popular with students.
