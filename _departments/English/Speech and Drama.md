### Speech and Drama    

Speech and Drama Fest 2021

As part of our schoolâ€™s effort to provide quality learning experiences and a language-rich environment for our students to learn English, the English Department has been conducting Speech and Drama lessons for our Primary One and Two students annually. With the new SMMs in place this year, we were not able to have our usual Speech and Drama concert. Instead, the performances were recorded by the English teachers and shared with the school. Each student also created their own mask during their art lessons. The students had a lot of fun!

The students definitely look forward to the next Speech and Drama Fest next year!
    
### P6 Post Exam Activity

2019

It was the end of PSLE, but not the end of learning for our Primary 6 students. Post PSLE, the students had been working hard during their English lessons, with the encouragement and support of their English teachers, of course!
We are certain that this is a memory that the students will treasure for life.
These are the newsletters that the students crafted.
