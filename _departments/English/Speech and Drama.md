### Speech and Drama    

Speech and Drama Fest 2023

As part of our schoolâ€™s effort to provide quality learning experiences and a language-rich environment for our students to learn English, the English Department has been conducting Speech and Drama lessons for our Primary One and Two students annually. The performances were recorded by the English teachers and shared with the school. Each student also created their own mask during their art lessons. The students had a lot of fun!

The students definitely look forward to the next Speech and Drama Fest next year!
