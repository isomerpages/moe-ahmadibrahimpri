<p>The SwimSafer Programme aims to equip students with essential water safety
knowledge, swimming skills, and survival techniques beyond regular PE lessons.
Through this programme, students build confidence in the water, learn how
to stay safe, and prepare for emergencies, all while having fun and staying
active! Students were introduced to important skills such as floating,
sculling, swimming in deep water, and basic rescue techniques. For many
students, it was their first time experiencing survival skills in a swimming
setting, and they rose to the challenge with great enthusiasm!</p>
<p>Our P4 students go through weekly lessons throughout a term and learned
swimming strokes and personal survival skills to feel more comfortable
and confident in water. They also cultivated responsibility for self and
others' safety, alongside resilience for new challenges.</p>
