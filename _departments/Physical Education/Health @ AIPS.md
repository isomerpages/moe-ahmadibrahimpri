<h3><strong>Health@AIPS 2025: Building Awareness and Motivation for Holistic Health</strong></h3>
<p>In 2025, Health@AIPS embarked on a new initiative to raise awareness and
motivation among students towards holistic health - nurturing the body,
mind, and heart for overall well-being.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, each term focused on a different aspect of health:</p>
<p><strong>Term 2: Physical Health – “Move Well, Eat Well, Live Well”</strong>
</p>
<p>Students learned how nutrition and physical activity work hand in hand
to keep the body strong and healthy. They explored balanced diets, made
thoughtful food choices, and discovered how eating well supports energy,
growth, and overall vitality.</p>

<p><strong>Term 3: Mental Health – “Happy Heart, Happy Mind”</strong>
</p>
<p>Activities such as the Gratitude Tree, Crumple to Calm, Open Mic, Walking
the Pet, and the Interactive Wall gave students meaningful ways to express
themselves, build gratitude, and learn simple strategies to care for their
mental well-being.</p>

playing paper ball with peers, exchanging and making loom bands, and contributing
to the interactive wall.</p>
