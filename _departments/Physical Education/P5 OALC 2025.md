<h4><strong><u>P5 Camp 2025: Bonding Beyond Boundaries @ Labrador OALC</u></strong></h4>
<p>Our Primary 5 students recently returned from an unforgettable 3-day,
2-night camp, “Bonding Beyond Boundaries,” a meaningful journey that brought
them closer together and strengthened their resilience.</p>
<p>Throughout the camp, students faced exciting outdoor challenges like <strong>high elements, team-building games, outdoor cooking, and orienteering</strong>.
For many, it was their first time stepping out of their comfort zones.
With encouragement and teamwork, they discovered they could achieve far
more than they imagined.</p>
<p>Evenings were a time for reflection and sharing, culminating in a campfire
highlight. The cheers, songs, and picture challenges showcased the students'
creativity and the strong spirit of unity blossoming among them.</p>
<p>More importantly, the camp reminded our students that true bonds of friendship
and support extend beyond the classroom. They learned to trust, lead with
kindness, and celebrate one another's successes.</p>
<p>The lessons and memories from Camp 2025 will stay with them for years
to come. We are confident that as they return to school, they will carry
forward the spirit of <strong>Bonding Beyond Boundaries</strong>—supporting
one another, embracing challenges, and growing together as one AI family.</p>
