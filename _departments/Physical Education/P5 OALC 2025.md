<p><strong>Primary 5 Outdoor Education Camp @Labrador OALC</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Primary 5 students recently embarked on an exciting Outdoor Education
Camp at the Labrador Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre (OALC). This memorable
experience allowed them to immerse themselves in nature, build character,
and develop essential life skills.</p>
<p>The camp featured a range of activities, including high and low elements,
orienteering, and team-building challenges. These activities encouraged
students to embrace teamwork, resilience, and perseverance while pushing
themselves beyond their comfort zones.</p>
<p>In a supportive environment, students were inspired to strive for excellence
and foster a lifelong love for learning. They also deepened their appreciation
for the natural world, strengthened friendships, and embraced values such
as responsibility, respect, and determination.</p>
<p>This enriching experience was a journey of growth, confidence, and connectionâ€”a
highlight of their educational journey.</p>
