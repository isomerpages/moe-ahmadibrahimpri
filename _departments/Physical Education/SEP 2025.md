<p><strong>Sports Education Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Sports Education Programme (SEP) provides Primary 1 to 6 students
with the opportunity to explore and experience a variety of sports beyond
their regular PE lessons. Through SEP, students can discover new interests,
uncover hidden talents, and develop a love for staying active—all while
having fun! In Semester 1, our Primary 3, 5, and 6 students participated
in SEP activities, each engaging in different sports to broaden their exposure
and skills.</p>
<p><strong>Primary 3 – Tchoukball</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the Sports Education Programme (SEP), our Primary 3 students
participated in a one-hour Tchoukball workshop held during school hours.
For many, it was their first experience with the sport. Students learned
the basic rules and skills, including throwing and rebounding the ball
off a frame, as well as team strategies for defending and scoring. The
session also helped develop important soft skills such as teamwork, confidence,
focus, quick decision-making, and sportsmanship.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 5 – Archery Tag</strong>
</p>
<p>Primary 5 students experienced Archery Tag in a one-hour workshop held
in school. Students learned how to handle a bow, aim, and shoot accurately,
while engaging in team-based games that involved strategy, movement, and
coordination. The activity also fostered important soft skills such as
teamwork (collaborating to plan and execute strategies), focus (maintaining
aim and awareness), resilience (learning from misses and trying again),
and sportsmanship (playing fairly and respecting others). For many, it
was a thrilling first encounter with the sport that combined fitness, fun,
and friendly competition.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 6 – Urban Laser Rifle Shooting</strong>
</p>
<p>Our P6 students took part in a unique and exciting experience – Urban
Laser Rifle Shooting! It was a one-hour workshop conducted during school
hours and held within the school premises. Students were introduced to
the basic techniques of aiming and shooting, practiced focus and hand-eye
coordination, and learned the importance of patience and perseverance,
self-discipline, and safety while handling laser equipment. For many, it
was their first time trying this precision-based sport, and they enjoyed
the challenge and excitement it brought!</p>
