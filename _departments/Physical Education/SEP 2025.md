<p><strong>Sports Education Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Sports Education Programme (SEP) offers Primary 1 to 6 students the
opportunity to explore and experience a variety of sports beyond their
regular PE lessons. Through SEP, students can discover new interests, develop
their skills, and nurture a lifelong love for being active — all while
having fun!</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Primary 1 – Wushu</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Primary 1 students had an exciting introduction to Wushu! This fun
and engaging programme introduced them to the basic movements and discipline
of traditional Chinese martial arts. Through simple stances, hand forms,
and coordination drills, students built balance, focus, and confidence
while learning the values of respect and perseverance. Beyond promoting
fitness, the Wushu SEP also nurtured an appreciation of Chinese culture
and heritage through movement.</p>

<p>Our Primary 2 students had a roaring good time participating in the Lion

<p><strong>Primary 3 – Tchoukball</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the Sports Education Programme (SEP), our Primary 3 students
participated in a one-hour Tchoukball workshop held during school hours.
For many, it was their first experience with the sport. Students learned
the basic rules and skills, including throwing and rebounding the ball
off a frame, as well as team strategies for defending and scoring. The
session also helped develop important soft skills such as teamwork, confidence,
focus, quick decision-making, and sportsmanship.</p>

This unique team sport, played with a giant lightweight ball, emphasized
cooperation, communication, and teamwork. Students learned to serve, receive,

nature of Kin-Ball fostered collaboration and mutual support, helping students
build coordination, spatial awareness, and strong team spirit — key values
both on and off the court!</p>

<p><strong>Primary 5 – Archery Tag</strong>
</p>
<p>Primary 5 students experienced Archery Tag in a one-hour workshop held
in school. Students learned how to handle a bow, aim, and shoot accurately,

coordination. The activity also fostered important soft skills such as
teamwork (collaborating to plan and execute strategies), focus (maintaining
aim and awareness), resilience (learning from misses and trying again),
