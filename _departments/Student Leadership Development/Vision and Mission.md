<h3></h3>
<p>&nbsp;In Ahmad Ibrahim Primary School, we aim to develop leaders of character
reflecting our school values of Responsibility, Compassion, Respect, Integrity,
Resilience and Gratitude. We believe that student leaders are able to make
a positive difference to others in serving their peers, school and community.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Our key beliefs</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Every student can be a leader.</strong>
</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Every student can lead based on his/her unique blend of
abilities, inclinations and talents.</p>
<p><strong>Every student should be developed as a leader.</strong>
</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; A leader should have the confidence and takes the initiative
to manage self and make a positive difference to others.</p>
<p><strong>Student Leadership development must be intentional.</strong>
</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Intentional student leadership development will ensure that
all students are equipped with the requisite dispositions and competencies
for effective leadership.</p>
