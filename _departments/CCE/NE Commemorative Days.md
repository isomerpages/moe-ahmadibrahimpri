#### Total Defence Day 2023
Total Defence Day (TTD) is commemorated on 15 February every year. This is to mark the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. This year, AIPS commemorated TTD on Wednesday 15th February 2023 with recess fringe activities which were supported by the PSG.  TDD-related Assembly programme was carried out on Monday, 13th February 2023. This year theme is “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”.  Through the arrays of activities, pupils learnt:<br>
- The 6 pillars of Total Defence – Military Defence, Civil Dfence, Econoic defence, Social Dfence, Digital Defence and Psychological Defence.
- how to play a part in each aspect
Pupils had the opportunity to learn more about the job scope in the military sector from our 2 male teachers. They also gained insights on the importance of food security through a skit focusing on panic buying. The fringe activities provided a chance for students to learn first aid bandaging, wartime food and test their knowledge about total defence. 

On the whole, pupils had an enriching experience learning about Total Defence.
