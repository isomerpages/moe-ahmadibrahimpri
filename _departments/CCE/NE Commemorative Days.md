These commemorative days are linked to important points in Singapore's history. In AIPS, we customise our learning activities and follow up with programmes to create holistic learning experiences and enriches students' experiences in National Education.
			
#### Total Defence Day 2023
Total Defence Day (TTD) is commemorated on 15 February every year. This is to mark the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. This year, AIPS commemorated TTD on Wednesday 15th February 2023 with recess fringe activities which were supported by the PSG.  TDD-related Assembly programme was carried out on Monday, 13th February 2023. This year theme is “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”.  Through the arrays of activities, pupils learnt:<br>
- The 6 pillars of Total Defence – Military Defence, Civil Dfence, Econoic defence, Social Dfence, Digital Defence and Psychological Defence.
- how to play a part in each aspect
Pupils had the opportunity to learn more about the job scope in the military sector from our 2 male teachers. They also gained insights on the importance of food security through a skit focusing on panic buying. The fringe activities provided a chance for students to learn first aid bandaging, wartime food and test their knowledge about total defence. 

On the whole, pupils had an enriching experience learning about Total Defence.

#### International Friendship Day 2023

We celebrated International Friendship Day on 6 April 2023 and the theme for 2023 was ‘Singapore in Asia.’

Many interesting activities were organised to highlight the importance of international friends for Singapore’s growth and the role it plays in the ASEAN region. Our NE Ambassadors, Ranjith Harris (4 Resilience) and Nalakini Tanlijaya (5 Diligence)  hosted the Pre-Assembly programme that marked the start of two weeks of interesting activities. 
Fringe activities comprises of a mini exhibition on a few countries, display of artefacts, international costumes and paper doll costume matching. These activities really engaged the students. 


The Assembly Programme by Storybook Theatre entitled, “The Lion &amp; the Mouse and the Hare &amp; the Tortoise” gave a new twist to the importance of friendship. FTGP activities, CCE reflection journals and Kindsville activities for the various levels brought home the theme, ‘Singapore in Asia’.
