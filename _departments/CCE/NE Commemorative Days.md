Students were engaged in a string of class activities to promote interaction in a multi-cultural classroom and to appreciate diversity.
Understanding that the traditional games that originated from different cultures were played by many regardless of race or religion, our lower primary students worked in pairs to play one of the traditional games, pick-up sticks.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the activity, “A New Way to Say”, our middle primary students learnt and penned down phrases in the different Mother Tongue languages and pieced their learning to form a beautiful masterpiece.&nbsp;

The National Day Observance ceremony was held on Friday, 6 August 2021. The theme for this year’s National Day is “Together, Our Singapore Spirit”.
Students were thrilled by the “Don’t Forget the Lyrics (NDP songs edition)” segment where they would stand to win attractive prizes if they could correctly recall the song lyrics from a variety of NDP songs.
In the “News Flash” segment, our student newscasters took us through some of the current challenges and how we could, as a nation, show resilience and be united as one to overcome these obstacles.
On this special day, we pay tribute to our unsung heroes at AIPS for supporting the school during the pandemic to ensure that meaningful learning continues to take place.

The ceremony ended with a fun Chairobics workout for students and staff to move to the beat.
The Class Mentors then led the classes in a string of class activities. Our students learnt more about the various SG mascots and had a better understanding of this year’s National Day theme and logo.
