#### Vision

Confident and creative students, passionate about developing their Potential and Talents in the Arts.

#### Mission
----

To provide quality experiences that promote students' awareness and passion for the Arts.

---
At Ahmad Ibrahim Primary School, we strongly believe that ‘Every child is a star’. The Art programmes are developed to help students learn to observe their surroundings, identify and describe the colours, shapes and texture of the things they see. They share their thoughts and feelings about these observations through artwork, discussion and writing. They learn to use different materials and media to create the artworks. We want our students to enjoy looking at and creating art and to have opportunities to showcase their artworks.
