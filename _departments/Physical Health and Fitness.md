      <p>Our Primary 5 cohort had their Outdoor Experience at Dairy Farm OALC, from 19 April - 21 April. The students enjoyed their day-camp, partaking in various team building and educational activities such as their Journey - a short hike through the nature trails nearby the campsite and Longkang fishing - where students observed the eco-system of the local pond and attempted to catch guppies using primitive means.
