**Fitness Friday**

Studies have shown the benefits of exercise on boosting attentiveness and academic performance in students. Every Friday morning, students are engaged in 15 minutes of light workout. Fitness Friday @ AIPS aims to promote an active lifestyle while making an impact on students&#39; academics at the same time.

**Health Fest**

An annual affair, the AIPS Health Fest is an event where students get to participate in sports and physical activities such as the handball carnival and mini games carnival. Students get to apply various skills and knowledge that they have learnt in their PE lessons on this day. In addition to the fun and games, students also get to learn more about leading a healthy lifestyle. They are introduced to various topics that complement what they have learnt during PHF lessons.

      <p>Our Primary 5 cohort had their Outdoor Experience at Dairy Farm OALC, from 19 April - 21 April. The students enjoyed their day-camp, partaking in various team building and educational activities such as their Journey - a short hike through the nature trails nearby the campsite and Longkang fishing - where students observed the eco-system of the local pond and attempted to catch guppies using primitive means.
