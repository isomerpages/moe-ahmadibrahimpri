<p>Ahmad Ibrahim Primary School kicked off the morning of 15 April with festive
spirit and joy at our Hari Raya Concert 2025!&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The celebration began bright and early with a lively pre-assembly sing-along
session led by Cikgu Dolah and our talented Primary 2 &amp; 3 students
– a beautiful way to set the mood!&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our concert then opened elegantly with a graceful dance by Nisrina &amp;
Dayana, followed by a special moment as Mrs Chia struck the gong three
times to officially launch the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The audience was thoroughly entertained by FunPlay’s engaging drama, Raya
Millenia, and we ended the celebration on a high note with a colourful
and energetic performance of Berkunjung Di Hari Raya by the AIPS Malay
Dance Club.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who made this celebration so special. Selamat Hari
Raya from all of us at AIPS!&nbsp;</p>
