<p>Our Primary 4 Malay Language students recently embarked on a meaningful
learning journey to Reflections at Bukit Chandu, a World War II interpretive
centre that commemorates the bravery and sacrifice of the Malay Regiment
during the Battle of Pasir Panjang.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During the visit, students were fascinated by the historical artefacts
on display, particularly the weapons and objects used during the war. The
exhibits provided a vivid and tangible connection to the stories they had
learned in class.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of the most impactful moments was the encounter with the Wall of Names,
where students read the names of soldiers who had fallen during the war.
This solemn moment evoked feelings of sadness and deep respect as students
reflected on the sacrifices made for Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The learning journey concluded with students expressing a strong sense
of pride in the courage shown by the Malay Regiment, especially the heroism
of Leftenan Adnan. The experience deepened their appreciation of their
cultural heritage and the significance of honouring our national heroes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As this was a rare opportunity to go on a learning journey with just the
Malay class, students thoroughly enjoyed the experience and shared hopes
of returning in the future.</p>
