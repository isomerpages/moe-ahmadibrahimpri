<h4><strong>Rolling with Confidence: MTL Broadcast Stars in the Making!</strong></h4>
<p>Our MTL Ambassadors have embarked on an exciting new journey through the
MTL Broadcast Journalism Programme — a hands-on initiative designed to
help them grow into confident, creative communicators using their Mother
Tongue Languages.</p>
<p>This specially designed programme offers students the opportunity to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Speak like a news anchor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use real filming equipment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Host interviews and present confidently</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan and produce short videos</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit their own video stories</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We recently conducted two in-house training sessions in Term 2, and we’re
thrilled to share the joy of learning and discovery our students experienced!</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 1: Stepping Into the Studio</strong>
</p>
<p>The programme kicked off with a fun warm-up where students introduced
themselves as if they were live on air — just like real news anchors!</p>
<p>They then explored what broadcast journalism is, watched engaging video
examples, and got up close with professional equipment like video cameras,
boom microphones, and LED lights.</p>
<p>In small groups, students created their own “mini news studios” and acted
out a 1-minute news report. Rotating through roles like cameraperson, anchor,
lighting technician, sound crew, and script holder, they worked together
and had lots of fun bringing their stories to life!</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 2: Pose &amp; Frame Like a Pro</strong>
</p>
<p>The second session focused on storytelling through the camera lens. Students
learned how to use different shots and angles — like wide shots, close-ups,
and low or high angles — to tell meaningful stories visually.</p>
<p>In a hands-on “Pose &amp; Frame” activity, students worked in pairs using
iPads. Taking turns as the cameraperson and the subject, they applied what
they had learned and practiced composing their own creative shots.</p>
<p>It was wonderful to see them experimenting, collaborating, and thinking
like filmmakers. Even small changes in camera angles sparked big excitement
— proving just how powerful visual storytelling can be!</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
</p>
<p>In Term 3, students will continue their learning journey as they dive
into interviewing and hosting skills — in their own MTLs!</p>
<p>We can’t wait to see how they grow as young broadcasters, using both language
and media to share their voices with confidence.</p>
