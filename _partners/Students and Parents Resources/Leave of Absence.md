#### Instructions
Parents who are planning to go overseas for work may reserve places for their children in their current school under the Leave of Absence (LOA) Scheme. If your child is granted LOA, they will remain as a registered student of the school and can be re-admitted to the school directly after returning to Singapore. 


##### Eligibility <br>
To be granted LOA, your child must fulfil all 3 of the following criteria:<br>
•	Is Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident of Singapore.<br>
•	Presently studying in a Singapore school.<br>
•	Accompanying you on an overseas posting with the intention of rejoining their school after returning to Singapore.<br>

##### Fee<br>
We will charge an annual nominal fee for a child on LOA.
Upon successful application, the school will advise on the payment procedure for the LOA fee.

##### Application<br>
To apply for LOA, please complete the LOA Application form via this [link](https://form.gov.sg/68db54084b93e0337c3072e2).

You may wish to know that the LOA is renewable annually. By November of each year, you will need to decide whether to renew the LOA for another year and your child’s LOA status will expire if you choose not to renew.

More information on LOA may be obtained on [MOE’s website](https://www.moe.gov.sg/returning-singaporeans).
