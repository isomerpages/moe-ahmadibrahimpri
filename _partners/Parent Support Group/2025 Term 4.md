<p><strong>1. PSG Parent-Child Bonding – Paper Quiling</strong>
</p>
<p>A total of 25 pairs of PSG members and their children took part in this
creative and heartwarming craft workshop. It was a fun-filled session that
provided parents and children with precious bonding moments as they learnt
the art of paper quilling together.</p>
<p>Participants also attended a parenting talk conducted by our AIPS SENOs,
and the session ended on a touching note — with each child writing a heartfelt
message to their parent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Children’s Day Celebration 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>Ahmad Ibrahim Primary School celebrated Children’s Day 2025 with a vibrant
carnival-style celebration filled with joy and excitement. The Parent Support
Group (PSG) played a vital role in supporting the various carnival stations,
ensuring that every student had fun in a safe and well-managed environment.</p>
<p>The PSG also hosted their own games booth and a lively doodling corner,
where students penned down their well wishes for AIPS in celebration of
the school’s 30th anniversary. It was truly a memorable and fun-filled
day for everyone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Deepavali Recess Fringe Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>In celebration of Deepavali, 10 PSG members collaborated with the Tamil
Department to conduct a series of fun and enriching fringe activities during
recess. These activities aimed to expose students to the vibrant customs
and traditions of the Indian community.</p>
<p>The activities were conducted across three recess sessions and included:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Oil Lamp Decoration
<br>Students were guided to decorate printed oil lamp designs using fresh
flower petals provided at the venue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rangoli Design
<br>Students decorated A4-sized rangoli designs of their choice with coloured
rice, creating colourful and intricate patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thoranam Tying
<br>Students learnt to create traditional thoranams (leaf garlands) by arranging
dry coconut leaves and tying them onto a string one by one, ensuring the
tips faced downward. Once completed, the ends were tied and adorned with
flowers.
<br> <em>(This activity was specially guided by our Indian PSG members, whose expertise helped ensure authenticity and cultural accuracy.)</em>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Through these activities, students gained a deeper appreciation of Deepavali’s
cultural significance while enjoying a hands-on festive experience.</p>

Day to welcome and engage new parents. The booth served as a platform to
recruit new PSG members and to share more about the meaningful contributions
that the Parent Support Group makes to the school community.</p>

support school programmes and events, as well as how they too can play
a valuable role in enriching the students’ learning experiences.</p>
