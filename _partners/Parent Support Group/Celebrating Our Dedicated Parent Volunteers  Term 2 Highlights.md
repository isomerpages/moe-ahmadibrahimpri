<p><strong>Celebrating Our Dedicated Parent Volunteers – Term 2 Highlights</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Parent Volunteers continue to play a vital role in supporting our
teachers and enriching our students’ learning experiences. In Term 2, their
involvement spanned various meaningful programmes and activities designed
to nurture holistic development.</p>
<p>In conjunction with <strong>International Friendship Day</strong>, our
parent volunteers helped raise awareness about the importance of building
strong friendships and embracing cultural diversity—especially in appreciating
peers from different countries and backgrounds.</p>
<p>In addition, a group of dedicated <strong>Malay parent volunteers</strong> went
the extra mile to support our lower primary students through the <em>Malay Buddy Reading Programme</em>.
Their efforts in helping students recognise and understand Malay vocabulary
have made a significant impact on our young learners.</p>
<p>Our committed <strong>Library Team</strong> also continued their mission
to instil a love for reading by conducting engaging storytelling sessions
in the library during recess.</p>
<p>A special highlight this term was when <strong>four of our parent volunteers</strong> conducted
a storytelling session in <strong>Chinese</strong> for our Primary 1 students.
Through this engaging session, the students were encouraged to appreciate
Chinese literature. By the end of the session, they also gained a deeper
understanding of the meaning behind adults saying “no” to certain actions
or requests—turning a simple story into a valuable life lesson.</p>
<p>We are grateful for the unwavering support of our Parent Volunteers and
look forward to more meaningful collaborations in the coming terms.</p>
