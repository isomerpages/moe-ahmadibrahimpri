<p>Our Parent Volunteers continue to play a vital role in supporting our
teachers and enriching our students’ learning experiences. In Term 2, their
involvement spanned various meaningful programmes and activities designed
to nurture holistic development.</p>
<p>In conjunction with International Friendship Day, our parent volunteers
helped raise awareness about the importance of building strong friendships
and embracing cultural diversity—especially in appreciating peers from
different countries and backgrounds.</p>
<p>In addition, a group of dedicated Malay parent volunteers went the extra
mile to support our lower primary students through the Malay Buddy Reading
Programme. Their efforts in helping students recognise and understand Malay
vocabulary have made a significant impact on our young learners.</p>
<p>Our committed Library Team also continued their mission to instil a love
for reading by conducting engaging storytelling sessions in the library
during recess.</p>
<p>A special highlight this term was when four of our parent volunteers conducted
a storytelling session in Chinese for our Primary 1 students. Through this
engaging session, the students were encouraged to appreciate Chinese literature.
By the end of the session, they also gained a deeper understanding of the
meaning behind adults saying “no” to certain actions or requests—turning
a simple story into a valuable life lesson.</p>
<p>We are grateful for the unwavering support of our Parent Volunteers and
look forward to more meaningful collaborations in the coming terms.</p>
