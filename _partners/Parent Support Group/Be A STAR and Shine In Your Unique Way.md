Time flies and yet another Primary 6 cohort is getting ready to sit for the national examinations. To show our support to our graduating students, the school came up with a motivational project- ' Be A S.T.A.R and Shine In Your Unique Way'.&nbsp;&nbsp;

We folded approximately 13440 stars and placed them into 192 bottles with hand-written encouragement notes on them. The star bottles were presented to our Primary 6 students in Term 3. They were really amazed&nbsp;and touched by the&nbsp;effort put in by our School leaders, teachers, Parent Support Group and office staff!
