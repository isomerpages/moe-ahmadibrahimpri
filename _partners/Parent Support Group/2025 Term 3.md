<h4>Celebrating Our Amazing PSG: Bringing Learning and Joy to AIPS</h4>
<p>In Term 3, our Parent Support Group once again demonstrated their unwavering
commitment to AIPS, creating meaningful and memorable learning experiences
for our students.</p>
<p>From bringing stories to life through interactive storytelling sessions—engaging
not just our AIPS students but also preschoolers—to running fun-filled
Recess Fringe activities that reinforce the values taught during assemblies
and lessons, our PSG has gone above and beyond to make learning vibrant
and exciting.</p>
<p>In a show of heartfelt support for our graduating Primary 6 students,
our PSG members handcrafted encouraging badges to cheer them on for their
upcoming PSLE, reminding them that the entire AIPS family is rooting for
them to “nail it”!</p>
<p>The PSG also joined in the school’s SG60 celebrations, lending their creative
touch by supporting performers with makeup and preparation, ensuring the
event was extra special.</p>
<p>We are truly grateful to our PSG for their dedication, creativity, and
enthusiasm. Thank you for walking this journey with us and for always making
a difference!</p>
