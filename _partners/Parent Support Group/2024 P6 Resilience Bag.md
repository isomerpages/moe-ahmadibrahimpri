<h4>P6 Resilience Bags: </h4>
<p>A Heartwarming Gesture from Our PSG</p>
<p>In a thoughtful show of support for our graduating P6 students during
their PSLE journey, our wonderful Parents Support Group prepared special
Resilience Bags. Taking time off from their busy schedules, our PSG members
handmade personalized notes of encouragement for each student, offering
words of support and motivation.</p>
<p>These small yet meaningful gestures remind our students that they are
not alone in this important chapter of their educational journey. A big
thank you to our PSG for their unwavering dedication and kindnessâ€”your
efforts truly make a difference!</p>
