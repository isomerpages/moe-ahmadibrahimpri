I was a student at AIPS from 1999 to 2002 and I have many fond memories of the school – the beautiful school compound, the marvelous teachers and above all, my peers whom I have forged lifelong friendship with! I still remember vividly how the boys of my class would always hang out together during recess time to play the rubber band shooting and hand clapping games that I had invented myself! It was during that time that I found myself to be someone with a creative touch and capable of leading a group of people, skills that are still serving me well till today.<br><br>
I was involved in several CCAs during my few years spent in AIPS. Two of these were - Aungklung and Gamelan. And I thoroughly enjoyed myself playing the various instruments in these two CCA groups. I had an opportunity to appreciate a different culture up close and personal. In fact, it was not an uncommon sight to see students of various ethnic groups participating in another race’s performance group. This reflected well on the racial harmony that Singapore has preserved over the years as the value of understanding and respecting each other has been inculcated since young.<br><br>
On the school’s 20th birthday, I would like to thank the school for all that it has given me. It will always have a special place in my heart! I also would like to wish my alma mater to continue the good work of nurturing useful members of the society for Singapore! <br><br>

My time at AIPS was characterised by: community, discovery, and opportunity.<br><br>
6/4 (2006) was a melting pot of some very colourful people. My classmates and I shared some unforgettable memories - of creating mischief when teachers weren’t looking; of surviving countless assignments and projects; of simply trying to make the most of our time together before we split up for secondary school. We were easing into the perils of teenage-hood, and have seen one another do some incredibly crazy things – which is why I enjoy my ex-classmates’ company up to this day, reminiscing about days long gone. This community of forty unique students chucked into a classroom and forced to be together, is one that I’ll forever treasure.<br><br>
My CCA for four years was the Harmonica Ensemble. Once or twice a week, I would get away from the monotony of schoolwork and direct my energy towards a different cause, whether it was the next performance or an upcoming competition. These memories of countless school performances, winning Gold at SYF 2006, playing at Victoria Concert Hall – will stay with me for life, along with the sense of camaraderie that we shared. It was there that I discovered a side of myself that I had not known before.<br><br>
As a student, I was ever restless and rarely content. Many times, my teachers had to put in extra time and effort on top of their heavy workloads to satisfy my curiosity. To that end, I’m thankful to them, especially to my form teacher of three years, Mrs Michelle Tan who had to put up with my never-ending stream of questions. AIPS gave me countless chances to develop myself – Robotics competitions, Scrabble tournaments, Leadership conferences, etc. – into the person I am today. More importantly, AIPS made me feel like there was nothing I couldn’t achieve, and that there was an abundance of opportunity in the world for me to grab – a feeling that mattered a lot to an ambitious, impressionable 12-year-old.<br><br>
My birthday wish for AIPS is that it continues to be a place that any student can call home. AIPS’s inclusiveness and welcoming spirit is something I’ve never felt anywhere else, and I sincerely hope every student who walks through her gates can find himself- or herself within!<br><br>

My favourite moment in AIPS has got to be when I was chosen to participate in the school&#39;s National Day Celebration. I was in Scouts then and my CCA teacher, Mdm Liesda chose me to be one of the four flag-bearers. I was honoured to have been given that opportunity to play an important role on such an important occasion. It was an amazing experience!<br><br>
When I was in Primary Six, my Form Teacher was Mdm Nadiah. She was my favourite teacher. She instilled in my classmates and me the mindset of excellence, diligence and perseverance. She encouraged us to persevere and strive on when the going got tough during those days leading to the Primary School Leaving Examination. We heeded her advice and achieved our goals.<br><br>
During my primary school days, I loved going to the school&#39;s library with my friends to browse through the collection of books available there. And the reading corners all over the school were my favourite relaxing spots.<br><br>
I am a proud AIPS Graduate. AIPS has moulded me to be the person I am today - resilient and embracing life!<br><br>

I am a proud graduate of Ahmad Ibrahim Primary School (AIPS)!<br><br>
My education journey at AIPS started in 2003. I am indebted to the teachers of AIPS who constantly strive to uncover and develop the talent and potential of students. When I was in Primary One, my Form Teacher, Ms Tan Su Hui discovered my keen interest in art even before I was fully aware of it myself! She nominated me for art contests and encouraged me to pursue my interest and further hone my artistic skills by joining the Art Club CCA.<br><br>
To my immense surprise, I was given the opportunity to be the illustrator of the cover design of the Pupil’s Companion book when I was in Primary Two. The school was so pleased with my design that they asked me to illustrate the cover design of the Pupil&#39;s Companion book for the next few years! When I was in Primary Five, I was again very fortunate to have the support of AIPS that led to the publication of my very own comic book, The Comic Garden. In so doing, I became the youngest local author in Singapore and my name was etched in the Singapore Guinness Record! In my final year of study, I was given the honour to design the “Reading is Fun!” mural which still stands today in the beautiful premise of AIPS.<br><br>
Despite having long graduated from my alma mater, I am infinitely grateful to AIPS for the endless opportunities that it gave me and continues to give me. Even today, as an alumnus, I am incredibly honoured to render my artistic assistance in the various school&#39;s projects.<br><br>
The school is turning 20! I would like to wish AIPS a &#39;HAPPY 20th BIRTHDAY&#39;! To all the teachers at AIPS, continue the good work in nurturing and developing young minds. And to all my juniors, grow with resilience and bring AIPS to greater heights!<br><br>
